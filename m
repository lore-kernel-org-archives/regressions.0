Lo, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker speaking!

That was 3 weeks ago. Afaics nothing happened since then (except the
other mail about this on the same day in this thread). Or did I miss
anything? And if not: How can we get the ball rolling somehow again to
get this regression finally fixed?

Ciao, Thorsten (carrying his Linux kernel regression tracker hat)

P.S.: I have no personal interest in this issue and watch it using
regzbot. Hence feel free to exclude me on further messages in this
thread, as I'm only posting this mail to hopefully get a status update
and things rolling again.

#regzbot poke
