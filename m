So you used various different data sources, and the desintation was
always the nvme device in the suspect slot.

That's a very interesting pattern.

This does sound like a fairly common pattern due to SSD FTL issues,
but I still don't want to rule out swiotlb, which due to the bucketing
could maybe also lead to these, but I can't really see how.  But the
fact that the affected systems seem to be using swiotlb despite no
good reason for them to do so still leaves me puzzled.
