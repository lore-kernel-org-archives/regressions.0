Hmm, so you want to generically allow toggling the flag from
userspace? I mean that'd be fine with me, but it would feel a bit
weird if you let's say have a partition block device, where you'd
toggle this, and then you have two levels of part scanning, and then
you toggle it on one of the part block devices there and so on, and so
on. Could that work at all with the major/minor allocation stuff?

But let's say you add such a user-controlled thing, if you'd add that
I figure you really also need a way to query the current state, right?
which is basically what I originally was looking for...

i.e. it would be really weird if we could set the flag, but not query
it in the first place.
