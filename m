Hi,

I don't want to spend my time on reading long explanations (which often 
are output of AI anyway so of questionable quality and trustworthiness).

But two GPUs look a case where'd likely get scenarions my patch series is 
fixing. The series doesn't fix just the composite sizing calculation but 
also improves resource placement logic which is very much relevant in GPU 
scenarios.

Either use mainline or base on the latest stable, either is fine in this 
case as things don't move that fast with PCI resource handling.

I've zero love for Ubuntu kernels because I once discovered their 
versioning is misleading claiming kernel version x but is based 
a commit < upstream version x (seemed to be based on some late x-rcY).
No idea why they do that but I suppose it could be corporate pressure 
(Ubuntu's release deadline comes before upstream version x is released) or 
some other unhealthy practice.

Yes.

Why are you even asking this when above long description text clearly told 
you supposedly understood why unconditional rounding is a bad idea?

Tail padding only applies to a case where there is 3+ composite resources.

2 composites case does only fill the gap between remainders with empty 
space.

Stable backport decisions are made by stable maintainers or more likely
their auto select scripts. There was time when I tried to get some 
important PCI fix included to stable but they didn't seem to end up taking 
it.

I've stopped caring that much myself but I think anyone could ask 
something to be included into stable, not just me so if you find something 
is useful, you should try to justify it for the stable maintainers yourself.
