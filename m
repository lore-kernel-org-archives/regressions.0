The problem is that the system76-acpi platform driver tries to create the exact same sysfs attribute itself for the system76_acpi::kbd_backlight device, leading to the conflict. For testing purposes, I've just rebuilt the kernel with the system76-apci color attribute renamed to kb_color, and that fixes the issue.

AFAIK further up in the thread (or a related thread) there
already was consensus to do this. Someone just needs to
write the patch.

The new color attribute causing the conflict has only
been in 6.6 so there likely aren't any users of it yet
and since dropping it would be backported to 6.6.y
there shouldn't be any future users of it either, since
any 6.6 users presumably will use 6.6.y and not 6.6.0

Ack.

Right.

If I have read the thread correctly it is not important the value
it represents is used internally in the LED subsystem and userspace
does not really need it.
