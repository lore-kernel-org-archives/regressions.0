Actually, this only helped in our test cases. Some of our users that
were affected with kernel 6.17 had no issues with kernel 7.0, while
others still experience those issues.
So those 2 patches only fixed the issues for a subset of users.

Originally we thought that it fixes the issue for those using KIOXIA
NVMes, while those with Microns were still affected. But since then we
had additional reports where users with KIOXIA NVMes also still
experienced issues with kernel 7.0.
This we only found out last week though.

We're still in the process of finding a reproducer that isn't fixed by
that change.
