It is a bit jarring to hear you call a rare place, where it doesn't
even actually work right, "meet the original expectations". :\

It is pretty clear the function doesn't do what it was originally
expected too anymore, and there are now so many call sites doing
different things I don't think that past is so relevant.

Umm. Is there examples in the tree of this ordering? I looked for a
while and I only found a bunch of counter examples..

Trying to order it before the bus is set feels like a big hack,
something so subtle should not be part of a driver facing API.

At this point, if it is to stay here, the functionality it needs
probably wants a new function name and no entanglement with the iommu
layer.

You never do actually explain it though. You throw some insults and
make a few statements and often don't answer any followup
questions.

The code itself is not enlightening, there are no comments explaining
these entanglements, these patterns you point to as "right" are not
really followed. The designs you explain as "right" don't fully
work. There are lots of little accumulated hacks to trip on.

It is a huge red flag that something so important as probing the iommu
is so completely baroque.

Well sure, fragile is how this kind of kernel work usually goes. How
many times has Thomas broke Xen refactoring x86 stuff? This is normal.

It is impossible to know what every crazy driver has done, and stuff
is getting broken. The point is to slowly make progress toward a
robust and understandable design in the core layer and facing the
drivers, especially one that releases the drivers of any complex
understanding.

We've made good progress on this front. The iommu drivers especially
are slowly getting more uniform.

Here we got a log message that points to something really WTF going
on. John's case is different and seems to have identified a real
race. I think we are doing pretty good on this.

It would be nice to come to conclusion on what should be done here
that improves and makes the driver facing API more robust. But it is
just a log message so maybe it is fine to leave it.

Okay, I didn't go through the whole patch, I was only looking at the
hunks in drivers/gpu/host1x/bus.c that added a new of_dma_configure()
call.
