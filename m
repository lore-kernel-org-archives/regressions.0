Sorry, I'm totally behind with tracking the progress for some
regressions because I'm busy preparing three talks :-/ Many thx for
letting me know!

FWIW, this is how you mail looked like here:

```
|I can confirm the fix.
|

|#regzbot fixed-by: |e2dcac2f58f5
||
"""

Regzbot ignored it, as the "#" has to be the first character in a new
paragraph. And the "|" before e2dcac2f58f5 would have confused it as
well. No worries, happens, that is easily fixed up:

#regzbot fixed-by: e2dcac2f58f5

But I wanted to tell you, as it's not the first time you tried to
interact with regzbot in a way that failed. I suspect you mailer does
something odd.

But as I said: no worries, things like that happen. :-D

Ciao, Thorsten
