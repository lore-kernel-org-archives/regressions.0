Subject: Re: [REGRESSION] PCI/AER: MacBookPro16,1 powers off ~20 s after boot

Follow-up: the trigger is one device, the T2 Secure Enclave function
(106b:1802, 04:00.2).

To find which device matters I built a diagnostic kernel on v7.3-rc6
(same config and recipe as the bisect, no revert). It adds a boot
parameter, aer_anfe_skip=3D<list>, that leaves the Advisory Non-Fatal
bit masked on the listed devices (a BDF, a vendor:device pair, or
"all") and logs one line per device at unmask time. Without the
parameter it behaves as v7.3-rc6 does.

Each boot ran on the same MacBookPro16,1, with kernel messages
streamed over the network. A cut means the machine powered off with
no clean shutdown; every cut so far has come before 27 s.

 #  masked (skipped)                      result
 1  all five functions that latch it      survived
 2  04:00.0 04:00.1 04:00.2 04:00.3       survived, 343 s
    (the four Apple functions only;
    the AMD switch port 01:00.0 unmasked)
 3  04:00.0 04:00.1 only                  powered off at 14 s
    (NVMe and T2 Bridge; Enclave and
    Audio unmasked)
 4  04:00.2 only (106b:1802)              survived, 120 s

So the AMD switch port is not involved. Test 3 cuts with the Enclave
and Audio unmasked, and test 4 survives with Audio still unmasked, so
unmasking the bit on 04:00.2 alone is what triggers the power-off.
Each case was run once; I can repeat them if that would help.

I still do not know why the T2 reacts. No AER message is logged before
the cut, and the Uncorrectable Error Status of that function is clear,
so this is only about the Correctable path that the commit enables.

Since the bit is only wrong on this one function, a quirk may be
better than a revert: keep Advisory Non-Fatal Errors masked on Apple
106b:1802, for example with a DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_EARLY entry that makes
pci_aer_init() leave the mask alone. I am happy to write and test
that patch on both of my T2 machines if you tell me which form you
prefer (a quirk flag in the PCI core, or a device-specific fixup).

The diagnostic patch, the lspci -vvv output and the captured boot
logs are available on request.

Thanks,
Jason Perlow
