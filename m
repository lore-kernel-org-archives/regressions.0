Hi Jason,

sorry for the late reply.  I had some email issues and am still
recovering from the backlog.

I don't know of any good way.  pstore has some ways to save kernel
messages, but it doesn't work to well with normal block devices in
case of crashes.

I'm a bit lost at the moment.

Two ideas I have, would be to

 1) boot with the intel_iommu=off kernel command line
 3) build a kernel with CONFIG_INTEL_IOMMU

and see if that works and report the dmesg.
