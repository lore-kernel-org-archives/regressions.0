And so it turns out that turning off an ACPI power resource associated
with a PCIe root port other than the one holding the affected NIC
causes the clock of that NIC to be gated which means that this is a
platform firmware issue (the shared clock should be represented as a
shared power resource in the ACPI tables).  The older kernels hide
this issue because they never flip the ACPI power resource in question
on and off in the default configuration, but it can be provoked with
the help of the runtime PM sysfs interface of the PCIe root port in
question.

A patch from Mario to add a quirk preventing D3cold from being used
for root ports on the affected system is available:
