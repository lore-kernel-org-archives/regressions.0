Well, if it something that started between v6.1.3 and v6.1.6 it must be
a backported commit from mainline that causes the regression.

But yeah, testing mainline would be wise to differentiate between "this
is something that is caused by a change in mainline" and "this is
something stable specific and might be caused by a bad or incomplete
backport".

It's not totally clear to me, but it seems 6.2 is affected as well?
Well, then it's a mainline issue. Testing latest mainline nevertheless
would be good to know if this maybe was fixed already.

But first something else: acidbong, why do you pass "pci=nomsi" to your
kernel? Maybe that makes your machine run in a unusual configuration
that directly or indirectly leads to your problem (which only worked by
chance earlier).
