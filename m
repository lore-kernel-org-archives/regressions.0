Good hint, thanks.
According to the latest debug log exactly that seems to be happening:

ieee80211_wake_queue() is called by the driver and wake_txqs_tasklet 
tasklet is started. But during execution of the drv_wake_tx_queue() from 
the tasklet userspace queues a new skb and also calls into 
drv_wake_tx_queue(), which is then run overlapping...

Not sure yet how that could cause the problem. But this breaks the 
assumption that drv_wake_tx_queue() are not overlapping. And TX fails 
directly after such an overlapping TX...

I'll probably just serialize the calls and then we verify if that helps...

Alexander
