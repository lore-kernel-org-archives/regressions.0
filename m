Thx, glad to hear that. FWIW and YMMV, but I'm not sure if fully
automating things is a good idea, as a bad report or two might be enough
to make some developers start ignoring kernelci reports; a quick human
review with small adjustments might help prevent that, as it's hard to
get that ship turned around later (that's why regzbot up to this day
doesn't send any mails automatically).

Yeah, especially a obvious "what's the actual problem (in 10 words or
less)" afaics would have been really good here.

Before going down that route I'd work out with Nick why things work for
him, maybe all that isn't needed.

Thx for your work!
