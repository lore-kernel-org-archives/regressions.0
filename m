This is the case. And the idea to let regzbot help with preventing what
happened here is not new and even written on a todo list. The rough plan
was to let regzbot just export the list of mainline commit-ids with
unresolved regressions (together with a link to regzbot's webui with
more details) -- then all Greg would need to do is something like "curl
example.org/unresoved_regressions.txt | grep 1f2e3d4c5b6a" in his apply
script to notice potential problems.

That was how I envisioned things might be good for Greg -- of course
before implementing that I would have talked to him about it. But
regzbot development stalled for about two years due to lack of funding;
we are currently ramping it up again[1], but it will take some time to
get things sorted, so this is likely not something we'll implement
tomorrow. :-(
