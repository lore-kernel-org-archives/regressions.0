It's tricky, yes, but I suspect the right time for a revert was weeks
ago. What Linus afaics basically wants in situations like this (espe.
with two reporters) boils down to "something broke recently, no fix was
found within a week or maybe two, so we go back to the previous state to
restart from there -- and this is nothing bad, that's just done to buy
us time."

If something is right by some hardware or DRM specs often doesn't matter
much. What makes this tricky is the fact that the revert might cause a
regression for those that relied on the functionally the change brought.
But I suspect even then Linus prefers a revert, as it's a recent change
that only went into 7.1. The quoted from Linus on this page cover this iirc:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/handling-regressions.html#quotes-from-linus-about-regression

If we can't agree on this, we maybe should ask Simona or Airlied for advice.

Ciao, Thorsten
