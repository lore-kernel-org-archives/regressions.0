You're right that returning 0 from the pm notifier would make the
problem that users actually care about -- laptop doesn't sleep when you
close the lid -- go away.

From a random.c perspective, the RNG is already initialized when the
driver loads, which will be before suspend bricks the driver. So even if
the behavior afterwards is a buggy driver handing all zeros to random.c,
it won't really matter much; random.c can deal with that
cryptographically. I have no idea if this is actually the case with the
driver's error condition. But if it is, it's good that it doesn't
matter.

So okay, I'll roll a patch to do that when I get home. I'm writing on my
phone now, but from memory it's just changing a 'return rc;' into
'return 0;'.

Then the TPM folks can fix the underlying issue at their leisure
whenever.
