Which is totally fine for me, I only want the links to the reports, too.
And I for now don't even care if the latter are added using Closes: or
Link:.

I kinda agree. OTOH I like even more when subsystem put the cover letter
text in a merge commit, *if* the cover letter contains important details.

For syzkaller it's redundant, yes, but for some other CIs and manual
reports it's useful and nothing new afaics (a lot of people just were
not aware of it). And FWIW, it's a warning, not a error to indicate:
there are situation when this can be ignored.

In case you want the backstory (which I doubt :-D ), see here:
