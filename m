Maybe some of my intuition, I'd be surprised if the slightly delayed
idle entry (because the vCPU stops the tick) explains the big difference,
so it's likely either:
- Hypervisor changes behaviour of a vCPU depending on when it's next
vtimer is armed (leaving the tick on means sooner of course)
- The tick wakeup itself is cause of the different observed behaviour.

To distinguish the two it would be helpful to know how many of the wakeups
are tick wakeups in the "leave tick enabled" case.
Also just to confirm, the reported metrics are just from a single workload
instance right? So we don't have to consider cases of "Leaving tick on doesn't
allow other system vCPUs to use the CPU as effectively", right? Or is this
possible here?

Agreed.
