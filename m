Reverting the patch seems to be the way to proceed. Then, work on another
way to address UAF.=20

I'm not aware of dvb users complaining about troubles due to UAF, although=
=20
it seems that there's now a CVE for it. So, maybe someone complained against
a distro Kernel, which caused the CVE to be opened.

So, while it is nice to have the lifetime issues fixed, last time I checked,
the USB dvb-usb/dvb-usb-v2 have some logic that usually prevents it to caus=
e=20
real issues during device removal, and unbinding DVB PCIe devices is=20
something that users don't do in practice.
