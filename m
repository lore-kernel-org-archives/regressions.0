[CCing Thermal maintainer Rafael, maybe he can help guide us]

Hi Bagas and everyone!

Bagas, it looks like you forwarded this to the maintainers of
"THERMAL/CPU_COOLING"; I think "THERMAL" would have been the way better
entry in MAINTAINERS, as many (all?) of the former are Linaro employees
and thus primarily care about ARM based devices. That's why I CCed Rafael.

I did some analysis using the 'stress' tool to measure and compare the difference in CPU temperatures between Kernel 6.4.3 and Kernel 6.5-rc3. Here are my results:

One thought: I wonder if there something wrong now or was there
something wrong earlier that was fixed to unleash the full performance
potential of the device. That 100°C there sounds like it's the latter
case, as that's the TJUNCTION temp for that processor. But would be good
to confirm from someone that knows better how hot such processors are
allowed to get these days.

Ciao, Thorsten
