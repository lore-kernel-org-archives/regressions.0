OK, great, that confirms the underlying issue existed all along, so the 
regression is only a change in who wins a fight between certain 
conflicting command-line arguments, which is arguably not so critical.

The rest of the evidence points to 88SE9235 wanting the same phantom 
function quirk as most other Marvell controllers, since although it's 
apparently been half-fixed such that DMA for two of the ports is being 
correctly emitted from function 0 - given that you say two of the disks 
*are* detected OK - the other two are still claiming to be function 1 
after all.

Thanks,
Robin.
