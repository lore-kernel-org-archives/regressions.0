Hi Thorsten,

travelling at the moment, but I=E2=80=99ll try. Not really into bisecting ke=
rnel issues, but let=E2=80=99s see where this goes. Another issue is, that I=
 don=E2=80=99t have a Toshiba Mini Click myself, so I need to build the test=
 Volumio images (volumio.org) with the different 5.16-rc kernel patch versio=
ns for a colleague to work with, hopefully  he has time to do this.

Thanks - G=C3=A9
