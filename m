Thx for this, as I had been thinking along the same lines already and
was still considering if I wanted to speak up.

6.18 still qualifies as recent in my book, but YMMV. And it's not like
people "took forever to notice"[1], as they reported this for a while
now -- and there were a few attempts to fix this; it just took us some
time to see the full problem (@Keith: many thx for that and the fixes
for them). And some of the linked reports are quite recent, so people
really hit this.

Sure, as always there is the risk that this will cause other, bigger
regressions. Maybe that's why it's one of those situations where the
right approach is "submit this separately to Linus and let him decide",
unless of course he speaks up here.

Another reason to maybe merge this now is that Btrfs regression that
likely will only be fixed next week[2] -- so we already risk needing an
rc8 anyway.

Ciao, Thorsten
