Thanks for following up here. I didn't initially see your follow-up
until Thorsten linked it. I apologize for missing that, this feature is
important so I don't want to see anything regress for it.

There is a known bug fix I think future tests should include:

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20260612223205.465913-1-kbusch@meta.com/

This likely isn't the fix you're looking for, but including it rules out
conditions that are not important here.

After that, can we try this suggestion and see if the hang goes away?

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/ajBb8tK-0aJBpIgF@kbusch-mbp/

I expect the original test case to still return an error (and I think it
was designed to), but it shouldn't produce the warn or bug splats with a
stuck uninterruptable task.
