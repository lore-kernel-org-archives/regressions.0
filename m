I just searched for the commit id of the culprit yesterday like this:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/?q=bdd8b6c982*

Which brought me to this message, which looks like Boris applied a
slightly(?) modified version of Jan's patch to a branch that afaik is
regularly pushed to Linus:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/166055884287.401.612271624942869534.tip-bot2@tip-bot2/

So unless problems show up in linux-next I expect this will land in
master soon (and a bit later be backported to stable due to the CC
stable tag).

You IMHO are expecting a bit too much here IMHO. Solutions to problems
in open source software get discussed on various, sometimes private
channels all the time. Just take conferences for example, where people
discuss them during talks, meetings, or in one-to-ones over coffee;
sometimes they are the only way to solve complex problems. But as you
can see from above link it's not like anybody is trying to sneak things
into the kernel.

Ciao, Thorsten
