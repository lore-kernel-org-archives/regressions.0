The latter is better because pci/resources is based at 7.0-rc1 and since=20
then, there have been two fixes that went through -rc series (I'm not sure=
=20
if either is relevant for your usecase, probably not but to be on safe=20
side it's better to include them as well).

BUT, it's easier to just merge pci/resource on top of -rc6 so you don't=20
need to pick the patches by hand). I think the merge should go cleanly.
