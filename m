Thanks for the detailed and throughout analysis! TL;DR for the ones too
lazy to read the whole report: Heavily parallel addition of inode marks to
distinct inodes contends on the superblock's inode_conn_list (and the
corresponding lock) which can reduce scalability of adding inode marks.

Just as a verification: Do I get it right that you observe no regression for
a case where single process is adding inode marks?

If the single-threaded case indeed isn't measurably affected, then I'm not
seriously concerned. Adding inode watch is comparably rare, I would
consider workloads which intensively add inode marks as kind of
pathological and so a scalability regression is acceptable tradeoff in my
opinion (at least for the time being). That being said I have experimental
patches sitting in my local tree which replace the list with rhashtable and
avoid pinning inodes by inode marks. These patches should improve the
scalability as well as a side effect. But I have to find time to revive
them and push them to completion...
