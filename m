You CCed him so maybe we'll learn soon.

I expect he doesn't like the situation, but at the same time I guess
there is nothing much he will do (which is why I do not CC him in cases
like this, unless they are urgent/severe or something like that).

That's because as far as I know in the end it is the duty of the
reporter(s) to find the the culprit.

Because in the end developers and subsystem maintainers are volunteers,
too -- and making them bisect each and every report would make the job
way to hard. And the question "which developer/subsystem maintainer
needs to perform the bisection" would often become quickly complicated
as well, as an issue in one area of the kernel can be caused by a change
in a totally different area (for file-systems that is way more likely
than for input drivers, but still). Not to mention that developer and
subsystem maintainers might not even have the environment at hand to
reproduce the issue.

That being said: I think a quick "We looked into these three reports
that might be related, but we have no idea what might cause this;
somebody needs to bisect things" from one of the involved
developers/maintainers would have been nice (appropriate?).

Ciao, Thorsten
