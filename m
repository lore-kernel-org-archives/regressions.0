Additionally, operating the isolated device in a VM on a constrained
environment like a laptop may have other adverse side effects.  The
driver in the guest would ideally know that this is a laptop and needs
to properly interact with APCI to handle power management on the
device.  If that is not the case, the driver in the guest may end up
running the device out of spec with what the platform supports.  It's
also likely to break suspend and resume, especially on systems which
use S0ix since the firmware will generally only turn off certain power
rails if all of the devices on the rails have been put into the proper
state.  That state may vary depending on the platform requirements.
