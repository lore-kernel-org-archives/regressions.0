Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker.

Bjorn, if you have a minute, could you please take a quick look at this

The reporter has some trouble with the bisection (see the ticket for
details), but it looks a bit like the problems are actually caused by
that patch or something in that series.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
