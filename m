That'll be safe, but it does mean that we'd need to *not* support pointer auth
for nested virt when we have a toolchain for which CONFIG_AS_HAS_ARMV8_3=n,
unless our minimum supported AS supports ARMv8.3.

If our minimum supported AS *doesn't* support ARMv8.3, then we'd either need a
new Kconfig symbol for NV_PAUTH support, or make CONFIG_ARM64_PTR_AUTH depend
upon CONFIG_AS_HAS_ARMV8_3.

AFAICT our options are:

(a) Manually assembly PACGA

(b) Change CONFIG_ARM64_PTR_AUTH to depend upon CONFIG_AS_HAS_ARMV8_3=y

(c) Add and use new Kconfig symbol for NV PAUTH, dependent upon
    CONFIG_AS_HAS_ARMV8_3=y

(d) Bump the minimum supported version of AS so that we can depend upon ARMv8.3
    support, and just open-code the ".arch armv8.3-a" in the NV pauth code.

... and maybe some variations on that.

Mark.
