Great, many thx. I looked for something like that, but failed to find it.

FWIW, a link to the patch submission would have been nice. I tried to
find it just now, but maybe it's not on lore.kernel.org or I did
something stupid. And
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/acpica-devel/ seems to lack
behind or might not be the list you submitted the patch to. Whatever.

I'll post a quick update there.

Thx again.
