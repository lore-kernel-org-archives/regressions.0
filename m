Thanks for the info!

Let's see what can be deduced from it.

First of all, the device is clearly accessible in pci_pm_init() and
then it somehow drops off the bus.  However, the complaint about the
failing power state change is not from the initial power-up.  It is
printed after setting the driver for the device, so most likely it
comes from pci_enable_device() triggered by rtl_init_one().
Interestingly enough, that message also says that the device's power
state before the attempted transition to D0 is D3cold, but that is not
the power state in which the initial power-up leaves it.  Had the
initial power-up left the device in D3cold, it would have printed an
"Unable to change power state" message which it doesn't do, so most
likely right after the initial power-up the device is actually in D0.

Since pcie_port_pm=3Doff makes a difference, the problem is most likely
related to what happens to the failing device's parent port.  Namely,
pcie_port_pm=3Doff simply prevents the port from going into D3cold which
indicates that the failing device drops off the bus because its parent
port goes into D3cold.  Indeed, that may be happening because the port
probes after the failing device has been initialized and if user space
flips the "power/control" attribute of the failing device from "on" to
"auto" after probing the port and before probing the device itself,
the port will suspend and go into D3cold.  Moreover, the device under
it is still in D0 when that happens because pci_pm_runtime_suspend()
does not change the power states of unbound devices (there is even a
comment in that function regarding the parent of an unbound device
possibly going into D3cold while the device is still in D0).  If that
happens, the pci_update_current_state() call in
pci_enable_device_flags() will update current_state for the device to
D3cold.

Of course, I'm not sure if this is what really happens and it still
needs to be figured out why things started to fail after introducing
the initial power-up.  I'd prefer to use the BZ ticket for
investigating it though.

Nevertheless, the above is a plausible scenario that may lead to the
observed symptoms.
