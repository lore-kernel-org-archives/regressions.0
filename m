I suspect recursion will make the results you get with that approach
useless.

We already have "trace max stack", but that only checks at process exit,
so it doesn't tell you much.

We could do better with tracing - just inject a trampoline that checks
the current stack usage against the maximum stack usage we've seen, and
emits a trace event with a stack trace if it's greater.

(and now Steve's going to tell us he's already done this :)
