Hi Alex, Thank you for having a look.

Although I narrowed it down to starting with 6.11-rc1, the first time
I encountered this was actually with an rc7 Fedora build.
http://riscv.rocks/koji/buildinfo?buildID=3D338433

I also did a build from upstream 6.11.1 last night and still see the
problem trying to boot with it this morning.

What you are describing here does not seem unreasonable to me, but I
simply do not know enough to say one way or the other.
Is there something I can do to collect more information to determine
if this is the cause?

Thank you again for having a look,
Jason
