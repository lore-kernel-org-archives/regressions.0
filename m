Summary: WiFi 7 MLO (5GHz+6GHz) on MT7925 silently stops passing traffic
after a few minutes, while the driver continues to report a fully
healthy link. Root cause appears to be a stalled WFDMA0 TX hardware
queue. Reproduced on both linux 7.1.8 (stable) and 7.2.0-rc7 (mainline
pre-release), not fixed as of rc7. Disabling the 6GHz radio on the
access point eliminates the freeze entirely in my testing.

This is a regression: reported by multiple users on the CachyOS forum
as broken starting with the 7.1.x kernel line; earlier kernels
(6.18.x longterm) are reported to work fine. I have not yet performed
a commit-level bisection but can if guided on the best approach given
the AP-side 6GHz dependency.

--- Detailed description ---

Symptom:
When connected via MLO (Multi-Link Operation, EHT/WiFi 7) with two
active links - one on 5GHz and one on 6GHz - network traffic silently
stops after a few minutes of normal use (web browsing, etc). The
connection continues to show as healthy:

- `iw link` / `iw station dump` report the connection as associated,
=C2=A0 authenticated, good signal (-60 to -65 dBm), high negotiated
=C2=A0 bitrate (800-1700 Mbit/s), 0 tx retries, 0 tx failed.
- Nothing is logged to dmesg/journalctl at the time of the freeze.
- Ping to the gateway shows 100% packet loss for several minutes,
=C2=A0 until the connection eventually recovers on its own.

I built a small watchdog script (ping-based failure detection + live
kernel log monitoring) to catch the freeze automatically and sample
mt76 debugfs state repeatedly across the event. This revealed the
actual mechanism:

`/sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/mt76/xmit-queues` shows the WFDMA0
hardware TX queue's `tail` pointer completely frozen while `head`
keeps advancing - i.e. packets keep getting enqueued but the firmware
stops draining the queue. RX stops in the same instant (rx byte/packet
counters in `iw station dump` freeze completely). No tx retries or tx
failures are ever reported by the driver, so it does not appear to
notice the stall itself.

Example from one incident (kernel 7.2.0-rc7):
=C2=A0 t+1s:=C2=A0 WFDMA0: queued=3D130 head=3D390 tail=3D260=C2=A0=C2=A0 r=
x bytes=3D184791894
=C2=A0 t+9s:=C2=A0 WFDMA0: queued=3D148 head=3D408 tail=3D260=C2=A0=C2=A0 r=
x bytes=3D184791894 (unchanged)

`tail` never advances during the whole stall window while `head`
keeps growing - the queue is being filled but never drained.

Reproduced this exact signature four times total (twice on 7.1.8-1,
twice on 7.2.0-rc7-1), always with MLO 5GHz+6GHz active, always
within 3-5 minutes of normal use.

6GHz correlation:
My MLO links are 5GHz (5180 MHz) + 6GHz (varies, e.g. 6135 MHz).
Fully disabling the 6GHz radio on the access point (FritzBox 5690
Pro, FRITZ!OS 8.25 - not just client-side band restriction via
NetworkManager, which does not reliably suppress the second MLO
link) results in 30+ minutes of clean operation with no freeze.
Re-enabling 6GHz reproduces the freeze again within minutes.

Regression info:
Multiple users on the CachyOS forum report this started with the
7.1.x kernel line; the previous longterm kernel (6.18.x) is reported
to work fine by another user with different affected hardware
(different AP). I have not personally tested 6.18.x myself, and have
not performed a commit-level bisection yet - happy to do so if
pointed toward the most likely area of the driver, given the AP-side
6GHz dependency makes a fully automated bisection awkward.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Connect to an AP advertising WiFi 7 MLO with 5GHz+6GHz link
=C2=A0=C2=A0 options, so the client negotiates both links.
2. Use the connection normally (web browsing is sufficient).
3. Within roughly 3-5 minutes, new connections start hanging;
=C2=A0=C2=A0 existing traffic stops.
4. Check `iw link` - link still reports as connected/healthy.
5. Check `/sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy*/mt76/xmit-queues` -
=C2=A0=C2=A0 WFDMA0 tail pointer frozen while head continues to advance.

(I am the thread starter; several other users report matching
symptoms with different hardware/APs)

Possibly related (different symptom, same 6GHz/MT7925 area, worth
checking for a common root cause):
Bug 221627 - MT7925E - System locks up with flashing caps lock
(comment 1 there: "caused by switching between AP's with the same
6GHz wifi name")

Attachments (will add to this ticket):
- Full incident logs for all four reproductions (dmesg + journalctl
=C2=A0 + mt76 debugfs time series across each freeze)
- iw station dump / iw link output during freeze
- Kernel .config

Note: checked bug 220424 (mlo_sta_cmd/sta_cmd regression) before filing -
different symptom (persistent near-zero throughput vs. our intermittent
full stall with healthy link stats) and different root cause (broadcast
wtbl hdr_trans_tlv handling). That fix landed in 6.16.6/6.17-rc5, well
before the kernel versions tested here, so it is not the cause of this
issue.
