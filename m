Yeah, I was slow applying this one, as I was afraid of it to cause
troubles. The DVB frontend state machine is complex, and uses a
semaphore to update its state. There was some past attempts of
addressing some lifetime issues there that we ended needing to revert
or not being applied, as the fix caused more harm than good.

The way DVB tuning works is that it uses a zigzag mechanism to
tune to a frequency. It actually tries to tune at several different
frequencies, like:

	f
	f + delta
	f - delta
	f + 2 * delta
	f - 2 * delta
	...

the DVB core supports 3 different types of zigzag approaches:
	- hardware-based - no need to do any special implementation;
	- software-based - Kernel will try the above tunes in in a
	  zig-zag way;
	- custom-based - the hardware has some helpers to speedup
	  and improve the tuning logic.

If a signal is lost, the device will re-run the zigzag logic.

It is not trivial to test all possible conditions there, and some
boards may have multiple frontend devices for different types of
TV transmission (cable, satellite, air).

As I don't have a DVB signal generator anymore, my tests were limited to=20
devices I have it handy that are compatible with DVB/T.=20

In any case, we need more details about the problem, as CX23887 is just
the media streaming PCIe bridge device. It tells nothing about what
frontend is attached to the bridge.

Mauro
