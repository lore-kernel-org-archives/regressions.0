As you can see, it was very much an intentional change.

Please don't justify changes with what is required for keeping things 
bisectable through a series (which I apparently failed to do by not 
recalculating the idx variable properly but that code is gone by now, so 
that omission is largely irrelevant at this point).

This is the intended behavior!

So all resources that were assigned prior to starting were assigned 
succesfully? Which would mean there was nothing wrong with the fail_list & 
ROM resource handling.

So far, all looks to be working as intended so the changelog surely needs 
a major revision to actually explain what the real problem here is if it 
comes down to the resource assignment algorithm having a problem. You only 
describe intermediate state related errors, and those are very much 
expected even when the algorithm works as intended.


This might be more a quirk territory if the resources were assigned just 
fine but some device fails / crashes when given a valid address for its 
BAR(s).

This kind of paragraph belongs below --- line.

...So the LLM says but I don't take it for granted. ;-)

There's also another level which actual does categorize the failures 
below pci_assign_unassigned_root_bus_resources().

If you think there's something wrong with SR-IOV behavior, fix that also 
but don't justify wrong level change with it.

But you need to explain what is wrong with the end state of the resource 
assignment algorithm, not the intermediate problems it shows while it's 
still running because those are expected and are there to help issue 
diagnosis (we could print just the end result but then who would be able 
to debug that?).

Sadly bugzilla is not working at the moment so I cannot check these but 
I'll get back to them later.

This isn't the right place for this. All failed resources should be 
returned for the algorithm retry / window resizing to work properly. 
Period.

This has been proposed earlier and it hasn't turned correct approach 
since then:
