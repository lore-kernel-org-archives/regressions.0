So I was able to reproduce the issue on qemu by adding a few tweaks, and 
indeed we trap in __warn_printk() on a virtual address but MMU is not 
enabled yet.

The following diff though allows me to pass this failure but I can't get 
much further in the boot since the tweaks I added won't allow it, can 
you give the following a try?

diff --git a/arch/riscv/errata/Makefile b/arch/riscv/errata/Makefile
