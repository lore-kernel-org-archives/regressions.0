What's the status here given that 7.3 will likely be released in a few
days? Note, I can see from the discussion that this is a complex problem
that can't be quickly solved. That's how it is sometimes. But I wonder
if the current state of things is the best compromise for now or if
Rob's revert or some other option would be better.
