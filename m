Yeah, you're right.  I was trying to get traces while doing something else, and didn't think that all the way through, sorry. :)  It's not going to be super easy to get a real trace (I was triggering the WARN_ON() from of fr0 getting set to to FPSCR), so let's just assume it's mainly the path you manually found above and update the commit message accordingly.

Now that's interesting as well, since it might explain some issues I've seen for years on a specific QEMU workload.  Once this is backported to stable I'll need to get the kernels updated on those boxes and see if the issues disappear...
