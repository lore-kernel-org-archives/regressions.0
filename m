Those as expected got merged, great. But I forgot to mention one thing
in my preface: there is a regression introduced in the 5.15 cycle where
I'd like to hear your option, as it's one of those tricky issues that
might need a judgement call, as it's security related.

The culprit here is 76a3c92ec9e0 ("cifs: remove support for NTLM and
weaker authentication algorithms"), which as of now afaics cleanly
reverts in mainline. As the title indicates, it's a change to remove
code in the interest of maintainability and security, but it seems some
people are now unable to access CIFS 1.0 shares on some devices (like
the media player "mede8er med600x3"). For details see:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAJjP=Bt52AW_w2sKnM=MbckPkH1hevPMJVWm_Wf%2BwThmR72YTg@mail.gmail.com/

[some backstory can also be found in the two bug tickets linked there,
which show the reporter is not the only one that ran into the
regression; see for example
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215375#c13 ]

I recently brought "should this be reverted" up in the discussion and
this is what Ronnie (who authored 76a3c92ec9e0) replied in
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAN05THQbR4d55kx6MEHGcn-iLZKJG1C0vhq19wfo=NrB6q1Apg@mail.gmail.com/

I also asked the reporter if win11 still is able to access the device,
and this is what he replied in
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAJjP=Bus1_ce4vbHXpiou1WrSe8a61U1NzGm4XvN5fYCPGNikA@mail.gmail.com/

Now I'm a bit unsure what the best way forward is here; if you have one
and want to share it, could you please do so in above thread (it's on
LKML, subject is "Possible regression: unable to mount CIFS 1.0 shares
from older machines since 76a3c92ec9e0668e4cd0e9ff1782eb68f61a179c"), as
that where everybody is CCed. tia!

Ciao, Thorsten
