Ahh, great. I had checked -next before writing my mail, but somehow
missed this one. Sorry. And thanks for your help.

This afaics was the last remaining issue of those reported in the
initial mail of this thread, hence telling regzbot to mark this as
resolved by that commit.

#regzbot fix: scsi: aacraid: Avoid -Warray-bounds warning

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

Everything you wanna know about Linux kernel regression tracking:

If I did something stupid, please tell me, as explained on that page.
