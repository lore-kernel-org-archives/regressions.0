The commit you referenced just turns on some functionality that most
people previously didn't have (but maybe could have, manually). So this
is a case of a new commit unearthing a bug in some old code. We had
something similar happen with a raspi driver and fixed the bug there.
From the looks of the lore link you provided, it sounds like the same
thing has happened already there to tpm? That this is already fixed by
that commit? I think if you have a system that's readily exhibiting the
issue, the best thing to do would be to try that series, and report
back, maybe even providing your `Tested-by:` line if it works.

I'll play around and see if I can repro too. Looks like you have a T460?
I don't have exactly that but maybe something close enough.

Jason
