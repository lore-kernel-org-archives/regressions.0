I don't have an old userspace. I built my system from source about four years ago using the methods from Linux From
Scratch and Beyond Linux From Scratch. I have been updating the packages since then as and when they are released. In a
way, you could equate my system to one of the rolling releases. It is very up-to-date but at the same time very stable.

This morning I updated to the latest releases of the 5.15 and 5.16 stable series. I've also built and installed the
latest in the 5.4 and 5.10 stable series. (All four had new releases yesterday.) Bluetooth works as expected on all 4 of
those kernels. It has also worked on every kernel released by Linus and every stables series kernel in the last four
years. I usually start trying out a development kernel when rc3, 4 or 5 is released, depending on time available. If I
find any problems I report them and provide any diagnostics required and test patches.

Bluetooth is unreliable on my system when I boot 5.17-rc kernels. There is little doubt in my mind that something that
has changed in 5.17 is at the root of this. Whether it is actually a bug in userspace doesn't change the fact that there
is a regression because of one or more changes in the kernel. As I said yesterday, my understanding is that such
regressions are frowned upon.

I'll try another bisection today, but limit its range to changes made in the net/bluetooth directory.

In the meantime I've copied this email to regressions@lists.linux.dev, so they can track this.
