No worries, it is easy enough to work around for our use case.

I attempted to print out the error code but it seems like there is no
output in the console after "reboot: System halted". If I add an
unconditional print right before the call to os_set_fd_block(), I see it
during start up but I do not see it during shutdown. Is there some way
to see that console output during shutdown?

Cheers,
Nathan
