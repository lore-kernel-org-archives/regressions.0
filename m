Why this was changed in the first place could do with some explaining,
as Valve had this implemented first in the SteamDeck (probably
collabora dev).
There were no other implementations out in the wild AFAIK & now with
the 6.8.x kernel, this issue has manifested because of an enum change.
I cannot for the life of me find an alternative topology file. Where
are the other implementations? Therefore it makes sense aligning to
what was done before on the Steam Deck OLED.
Alternatively, if Valve could provide an updated topology file for
6.8+ kernels, that would be great too.
Just my two cents from a humble OS dev, trying to make stuff work.
