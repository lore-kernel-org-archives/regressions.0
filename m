BTW, there is another report about this issue here:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2182228

/me wonders if there is a opensuse report as well, but a quick search
didn't find one

And as fun fact or for completeness, the issue even made it to reddit, too:
https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/121htxn/btrfs_discard_storm_on_62x_kernel/

Thx for your comments Christoph. Quick question, just to be sure I
understand things properly:

I assume on some of those problematic devices these discard storms will
lead to a performance regression?

I also heard people saying these discard storms might reduce the life
time of some devices - is that true?

If the answer to at least one of these is "yes" I'd say we it might be
best to revert 63a7cb130718 for now.

/me would be interested in answers to these questions as well

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
