Hello,

I see the point that this code has been living in the kernel for a
long time now and that it becomes more difficult to justify it as
a regression; I reported it as such based on the supposition that
the current fix is not the proper one and that technically this
support was broken between the identified commits.

If this situation is incompatible with a regression report then it
can be dropped as one and we keep it is as a bug report for which
we are looking for input from the community.

I agree that this needs to be fixed in the driver since all other
drivers are working fine with e611f8cd8717, and yes, all of the
drivers in question are in mainline, where we performed the bissection.

Thank you,

Diogo Ivo
