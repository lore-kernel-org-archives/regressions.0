Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker.

I noticed a regression report in bugzilla.kernel.org. Jason, apparently
it's caused by a change of yours (3bc753c06dd0 ("kbuild: treat char as
always unsigned")), which apparently caused a problem in
drivers/input/mouse/focaltech.c to surface. Someone provided a patch
already to fix it here: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/77733?getfile=22498

Back to the bug. As many (most?) kernel developer don't keep an eye on
bugzilla, I decided to forward it by mail. Quoting from
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217211 :

See the ticket for more details.


[TLDR for the rest of this mail: I'm adding this report to the list of
tracked Linux kernel regressions; the text you find below is based on a
few templates paragraphs you might have encountered already in similar
form.]

BTW, let me use this mail to also add the report to the list of tracked
regressions to ensure it's doesn't fall through the cracks:

#regzbot introduced: 3bc753c06dd0
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217211
#regzbot title: kbuild/input: focaltech touchpad driver misbehaves due
to a checke how to treat char
#regzbot ignore-activity

This isn't a regression? This issue or a fix for it are already
discussed somewhere else? It was fixed already? You want to clarify when
the regression started to happen? Or point out I got the title or
something else totally wrong? Then just reply and tell me -- ideally
while also telling regzbot about it, as explained by the page listed in
the footer of this mail.

Developers: When fixing the issue, remember to add 'Link:' tags pointing
to the report (e.g. the buzgzilla ticket and maybe this mail as well, if
this thread sees some discussion). See page linked in footer for details.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
