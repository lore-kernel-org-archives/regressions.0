Yes, that's correct. We used to have a bit more code around to deal with
single domain (Tegra SMMU is supported on some platforms where we have a
maximum of 4 address spaces, hence we have to be very careful about what
devices share which address space).

In fact the host1x and DRM drivers also support Tegra20, which didn't
have an IOMMU at all, but one of those really old GARTs. On top of that
it only supported a 32 *M*iB window. I think others have concluded that
today we can't practically use GART and it's better to use something
like CMA for those cases. So maybe that's not an argument anymore.

Most of these restrictions no longer apply as of Tegra124 (I think) and
starting with Tegra186 the IOMMU is an ARM SMMU, so none of these work-
arounds should be needed there. Most of this code exists for very legacy
reasons, but there's still people with Tegra30, Tegra114, Tegra124 and
Tegra210, all of which are susceptible to this (at least partially).

I should revive an old patch series that attempted to get rid of most of
this. The plan was indeed to remove all of the direct IOMMU API code and
use DMA API exclusively. There were a couple of issues with it, such as
performance regressions due to the extra mappings required, but I think
I got pretty far in mitigating most of those.

In the end I got frustrated with it a few years back because there are
some corner cases that I couldn't make work and testing of this becomes
increasingly complicated. And yes, display was specifically an issue on
Tegra210 platforms (earlier platforms didn't usually set up display on
boot).

One additional problem with supporting the reserved-memory identity
mappings is that existing firmware doesn't set things up correctly and
these devices are software EOL'ed, so no new releases are planned that
could contain a fix for this.

This might indeed be a viable path. Again, we need to be careful about
the older devices, but maybe a shared dma-iommu domain would work these
days.

We definitely want to transition to a DMA IOMMU domain later on, but it
would need to be after display has had a chance to set things up. And it
would still need a firmware that actually passes the right information
to DT because otherwise we'd still get SMMU faults from the display
hardware trying to scan out from memory that it doesn't own (or I guess
scanning out garbage from memory that's now being used for other
purposes).

reserved-memory is the DT equivalent of ACPI's RMR, as far as I
understand. Or at least, it's the closest thing to it. We don't have
ACPI on these devices, hence why we do this via reserved-memory DT
nodes. But again, the problem is that firmware doesn't currently pass
this correctly to the kernel, so we'd need a new release for that. I'd
need to find out what can be done to achieve this. One big issue might
be that it'd be a DT ABI break, technically. So upstream Linux would
only work reliably using that new version. That might be fine if we can
make some sort of official release.

Yeah. We do something similar for Tegra186 and later where we have the
memory controller redirect accesses to the SMMU only after the device
has been attached. I'm not sure if we can do that for the old Tegra
SMMU, though. It would probably still require a firmware update to make
sure this can be properly handed off to the kernel.
