I'm removing this from the list of tracked regressions, because as I
understand things a revert would cause a regressions itself; a quick fix
sadly is not really possible and a proper one already WIP[1]. There
hence is not much worth tracking this. Should happen in a ideal world,
but that's how it is sometimes:

#regzbot inconclusive: revert no option and a proper fix will take some time
#regzbot ignore-activity

[1] afaics it's this, but I might be wrong with
