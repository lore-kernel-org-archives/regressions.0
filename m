I'm confused about this issue.  Correct me if I go wrong:

The hierarchy is:

  00:1c.4 Root Port to [bus 04-3c]
  04:00.0 Upstream Port (Thunderbolt) to [bus 05-3c]
  05:01.0 Downstream Port (Thunderbolt) to [bus 07-3b]
  07:00.0 Upstream Port (Thunderbolt) to [bus 08-3b]

With security level=secure, before e8b908146d44 ("PCI/PM: Increase
wait time after resume"), resume takes ~5 seconds, but the hierarchy
below 05:01.0 gets removed and re-enumerated (dmesg [1]).  After
e8b908146d44, the same thing happens except the resume takes 60+
seconds (dmesg [2]).  In both cases, the devices (USB mouse, LAN, etc)
below 05:01.0 work after resume.

With security level=user, resume takes << 5 seconds regardless of
e8b908146d44, and the hierarchy below 05:01.0 does not get removed and
re-enumerated (dmesg [3]).

So if that's all accurate, it sounds like we've always had some
problem with security level=secure that causes the hierarchy to get
removed and re-enumerated, and e8b908146d44 just makes this problem
much more visible?

I don't know anything at all about how Thunderbolt security levels
work.  If "secure" means the hierarchy must be re-enumerated after
resume, we can detect that case immediately and get on with it without
having to wait for a timeout?
