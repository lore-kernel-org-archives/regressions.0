Fair enough. Or we could try bumping it from v1.1 to v2.0 (or v3.0 if
we make it a bit mask).

Akihiro, would you mind checking if changing the major/minor to any of
these values results in the same problem?

Unfortunately, the only data point we have is that a non-EFI
bootloader (which is unlikely to carry a PE/COFF loader) needs the
byte at that specific offset to be 0x0, and we really have no idea
why, or whether we could hit this in other ways (i.e., by changing the
PE/COFF header to comply with new MS requirements for secure boot,
which is another thing that is in progress)

For x86, it doesn't actually make a difference, but on other
architectures, the command line initrd=3D loader could be disabled, but
that possibility was removed. The idea was that by bumping the version
to v1.1 at the same time, generic EFI loaders would be able to
identify this capability without arch specific conditionals in the
logic.

Currently, GRUB and systemd-stub check this version field, but only
for v1.0 or higher. Upstream GRUB  switched to this generic version of
the EFI loader just this week, but does not actually use initrd=3D at
all for EFI boot (on any architecture).

Yeah, maybe you're right. Currently, only a single feature is tied to
LINUX_EFISTUB_MAJOR_VERSION=3D=3D1 (LoadFile2 support for initrd loading),
and this PE/COFF version field has no meaning to UEFI firmware itself,
so we could simply treat these fields as bit masks if we wanted to
(and setting the initrd command line loader bit for x86 would be
redundant anyway)

But not being able to freely set such a bit because some rarely used
non-EFI BIOS implementation imposes requirements on the contents of
the EFI specific image header is rather disappointing.
