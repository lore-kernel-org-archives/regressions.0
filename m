I believe the confusion comes from "Bluetooth: btmtk: accept too short 
WMT FUNC_CTRL events" itself currently having different commit hashes in 
bluetooth (e3ac0d9f1a20) and bluetooth-next (162b1adeb057). The former 
correctly refers to "Bluetooth: btmtk: validate WMT event SKB length 
before struct access" as 634a4408c061 in the Fixes tag and was merged 
into net yesterday heading for 7.1-rc5. The latter still refers to it as 
041e88fb0c08. Both are now in next-20260519 but only the latter was in 
next-20260518 which was the latest at the time of Thorsten's message.

Greg, this means picking e3ac0d9f1a20 instead of 162b1adeb057 should 
result in a valid Fixes tag.

August Wikerfors
