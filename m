Hi! Thx for the report.

And a few days ago made it to 7.1.9 and 6.18.45. :-/

Not my area of expertise, so the bluetooth maintainers might disagree
with me, but FWIW:

Given the above and the fact that we are in the merge window right now
I'd say the better approach would be to fix this fast by reverting the
culprit in mainline (then stable can pick up the revert to fix the
problem there) to buy time to work this out properly.

Would you maybe be willing to submit a revert?

Ciao, Thorsten
