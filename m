Sorry for the confusion, I missed the part where I do see these
messages when the kernel module is loaded but the direct firmware
loading fails.

Bluetooth: hci0: setting up wcn399x
Bluetooth: hci0: QCA Product ID   :0x0000000a
Bluetooth: hci0: QCA SOC Version  :0x40010214
Bluetooth: hci0: QCA ROM Version  :0x00000201
Bluetooth: hci0: QCA Patch Version:0x00000001
Bluetooth: hci0: QCA controller version 0x02140201
Bluetooth: hci0: QCA Downloading qca/crbtfw21.tlv
bluetooth hci0: Direct firmware load for qca/crbtfw21.tlv failed with error -2
Bluetooth: hci0: QCA Failed to request file: qca/crbtfw21.tlv (-2)
Bluetooth: hci0: QCA Failed to download patch (-2)
Bluetooth: hci0: QCA preshutdown_cmd failed (-56)

This happens in all the cases (working and non-working BT) because
filesystem is not mounted by that time. I'm running AOSP and all the
kernel modules get loaded from a ramdisk. But in the working case, the
firmware loading kicks in again later in the boot process and BT gets
initiazed..

With this patch, after the first attempt to load the firmware fails,
the firmware loading doesn't kick-in again. Also even if I keep the
firmware in ramdisk then the direct firmware loading from ramdisk
happens but BT still doesn't work

I don't see any relevant error message in dmesg. I'll check if I can
find a command line BT debug tool which I can use on AOSP for
debugging. There used to be a few hci command line tools, when I
looked into it a few years ago. Not sure if they are still around and
useful.
