An issue that looked like a network bug was now bisected and it turns

linked above?

FWIW, the whole story started like this:

Meanwhile a few others that ran into the same problem with NICs from
different vendors joined the ticket

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
