correct. But the HW is faulty and a new firmware version works, so it's
not like there is no options. But...

Not sure we replied to the original thread. That's an omission from us,
but OTH, the "fix" was only in linux-next, never in a realease kernel,
so it was just a delay introduced.

Sigh. The fix that was introduced in the previous release cycle was a
"security" one. Which explained it had a fast path in being merged into
the kernel and into stable. I hate those but there was something
fundamentally wrong in the hid core code. We already got numerous
reports that the fix is not breaking other devices but is way too
verbose, so a proper fix is on its way, as soon as I managed to properly
test it on my machine.

Should be out today or tomorrow, depending if my machine still randomly
freeze because of the latest 7.0-rc bugs

GPD specific -> no, it's basically restoring the old behaviour where we
authorize shorter reports, but only if the provided buffer is big
enough. This is is the case when we are dealing with an actual call from
a transport layer like USB or I2C, but not from uhid.

Yes, again, please redirect your wrath to the persons who decided that
this kind of bugs (that we admitedly have to fix) are security in some
cases :) 

But yeah, security bugs are an annoyance for anybody, and we are far
from seeing the end of it.

Cheers,
