Bisect is done. First bad commit:

ff643b81bc38eaff6c0ab783a62e4ba9e10d2476
wifi: mt76: mt7925: pass mlink and mconf to sta_mld_tlv()
Sean Wang, 2026-03-06
https://patch.msgid.link/20260306232238.2039675-4-sean.wang@kernel.org

Bisected on vanilla, path-restricted to
drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/mt7925/, using v7.0 as good and
v7.1 as bad. Each step was booted and tested with MLO active
(5GHz+6GHz, FritzBox 5690 Pro), and every "bad" verdict was confirmed
by the WFDMA0 signature (tail frozen while head keeps advancing),
not just by the connection dropping.

   ea757740dd87  pass WCID indices to bss_basic_tlv()      good (45 min 
clean)
   ff643b81bc38  pass mlink and mconf to sta_mld_tlv()     bad (freeze 
after ~4 min)
   dc019e3294c7  pass mlink to mcu_sta_update()            bad (freeze 
after ~3 min)
   9e4d518a4707  pass mlink to mac_link_sta_remove()       bad (freeze 
after ~4 min)
   cf9db836b1e0  pass mlink to set_link_key()              bad (freeze 
after ~4 min)

git bisect log and the incident logs for each step are available if
useful - happy to attach them to the bugzilla ticket or send them
here.

Let me know if you want anything else tested.

Thanks,
Jonas
