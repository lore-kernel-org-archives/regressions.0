Ugh, yeah, this sounds like a really bad idea. Conceptually GPIO drivers
are consumers of a pinctrl device and by now making the pinctrl device
depend on GPIO chips you make the dependency recursive, which is exactly
what you're observing here. And it's honestly not a surprise that this
breaks. It is rather surprising that this has worked before in the first
place.

Now, looking through some of the pin control documentation, I see that
this kind of setup is actually encouraged (see "Interaction with the
GPIO subsystem" in Documentation/driver-api/pin-control.rst). This may
make sense for cases where the GPIO chips can be hard-coded, but I don't
see how that would work in practice.

Looking at a random sampling of drivers, I see a lot of those that are
calling pinctrl_add_gpio_range() are setting the .gc field to point at a
GPIO controller. However, in the cases that I've seen, they are all very
tightly integrated with the pinctrl such that they don't have to do that
same dance that AT91 does (where pinctrl and GPIO drivers are separate),
so they avoid the circular dependency. A couple of examples are here:

	- bcm/pinctrl-bcm2835.c
	- pinctrl-starfive.c
	- pinctrl-st.c
	- renesas/pinctrl-rza1.c
	- renesas/pinctrl-rza2.c
	- samsung/pinctrl-samsung.c
	- stm32/pinctrl-stm32.c

pinctrl-xway.c is another, slightly different variant that references a
file-scoped struct gpio_chip, so it's again in that "tightly coupled"
category.

tegra/pinctrl-tegra.c gets away without setting the .gc field and
instead uses a hard-coded number of GPIO lines in the range. The same
goes for mvebu/pinctrl-mvebu.c which uses platform data to pass GPIO
ranges information.

Given all of the above, it sounds to me like the right way to fix this
would be to do two things:

	1) avoid the circular dependency by not waiting for all GPIO
	   chips to get probed within the pinctrl driver's ->probe()

	2) use the standard, DT-based mechanism to register GPIO ranges
	   with the pinctrl

Typically 2) would involve adding the gpio-ranges properties to the GPIO
controllers' DT nodes. However, it looks like it might also be possible
to avoid this in the AT91 driver by making it register the GPIO ranges
=66rom the GPIO driver's ->probe() function. That would typically be
slightly tricky because you don't typically have a back-reference to the
pinctrl device from the GPIO chip. *However*, it looks like on AT91-
based platforms the GPIO controllers are actually children of the pin
controller, which would nicely solve that problem (you can get the
reference to the pin controller via the GPIO controllers' parent). I
have not checked exhaustively if that's always the case, just for a
couple of AT91-based DTS files, but I suspect that this is a common
scheme for this type of device.

Note that the fact that GPIO controllers are children of the pin
controller is another indicator for why the circular dependency is a bad
idea. After all you can't have children without a parent. Parents need
to be "fully initialized" before they can procreate.

If you wanted to make this really complicated you could perhaps achieve
what that driver is currently trying by using the component driver
infrastructure. That would basically involve initializing the pin
controller fully so that it's ready to be used by the GPIO controllers
and then once all GPIO controllers have been added, a special callback
will be called, allowing you to complete the initialization of all the
components (which could then be used to add the GPIO ranges). I don't
think that's necessary in this case, though.
