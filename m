First off: David, Filipe, many thx for your answers, that helped me a
lot to get a better picture of the situation!

Yeah, definitely. That basically why I had hoped from a rough assessment
from the btrfs maintainers.

So I assume there are no other reports like this? Great!

Bruno, under these circumstances I'd say you need to bisect this to get
us closer to the root of the problem (and a fix for it). Sadly that how
it is sometimes, as briefly explained here:

Yeah, but it was this thread that made me aware of the issue -- and just
like [3] it didn't get a single reply from a btrfs maintainer, so I had
to assume the report was ignored. A quick "we have no idea what my cause
this issue and it's the only report with such symptoms so far; could you
please bisect" would have made me happy already. :-D

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I'm getting a lot of
reports on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them and lack
knowledge about most of the areas they concern. I thus unfortunately
will sometimes get things wrong or miss something important. I hope
that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to tell me
in a public reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record
straight.
