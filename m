That is not much relevant, what is relevant is the bug report and the
activity, in this case this thread.

The workaround: maybe. But getting it fixed is what you want, and the
workaround might be the wrong solution for that. That's up for the
developers of the affected area to decide.

But the thing is, this thread got messy and doesn't work on its own
anymore (it should ideally answer questions like "What does the
workaround look like" without providing a URL, as developers are busy
and might not follow it; any by now devs likely have totally forgotten
what this is about, so a kind of re-start might be needed).

But maybe we are lucky, and some developers of this area will reply
within the next two or three days.

If not, I'd suggest checking if 6.19 vanilla is still affected (fixing
6.12.y comes later, so let's ignore that for now). If it is, check if
the workaround from Ubuntu fixes it there. It might even make sense to
check if a revert of the culprit fixes it, too. Then report your
findings and sum up the situation briefly (somewhat similar to a new bug
report; people likely have forgotten what this thread is about). That
should work as a good base to restart things here.

Ciao, Thorsten
