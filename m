Deren Wu asked me privately if I'm using the latest firmware, and I
wasn't. I updated the firmware and now the problem doesn't happen.
The firmware where the problem happens is
mediatek/WIFI_RAM_CODE_MT7922_1.bin from the linux-firmware commit
e2d11744ef (file size 826740, md5sum 8ff1bdc0f54f255bb2a1d6825781506b),
the one where the problem doesn't happen is from the commit 6569484e6b
(file size 827124, md5sum 14c08c8298b639ee52409b5e9711a083). I haven't
tried the version committed between these ones.
Not sure if this should be reported to regzbot and if there are any
further actions needed by the kernel maintainers.
