I am aware of this and looking into it. The patch mentioned above seems to have
introduced the issue that drives are not being stopped on shutdown with real
PCs. But they are with qemu VM. So this seems to relate to ACPI shutdown as
well. Not sure, looking into it.

The main issue I have is that I cannot reproduce the old behavior mentioned in
this case, which is, the counters not incrementing on shutdown. They do increase
for me, always, even prior to the patch mentioned above.

Digging.
