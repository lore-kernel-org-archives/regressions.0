Greg, just so you know, that patch (which is also queued for 6.1 and
5.15) is known to cause a regression in 6.5-rc. To quote
https://lore.kernel.org/all/11fc981c-af49-ce64-6b43-3e282728bd1a@gmail.com/

```
Laptop shows a kernel crash trace after a first suspend to ram, on a
second attempt to suspend it becomes frozen solid. This is 100%
repeatable with a 6.5-rc2 kernel, not happening with a 6.4 kernel - see
the attached dmesg output.

I have bisected the kernel uilds and it points to :
[40613da52b13fb21c5566f10b287e0ca8c12c4e9] PCI: acpiphp: Reassign
resources on bridge if necessary

Reversing this patch seems to fix the kernel crash problem on my laptop.
```

Ciao, Thorsten

P.S.: I only noticed this by chance and yet again wonder how to handle
these situations better. I guess exporting the list of regressions
regzbot tracks in some simple format might be a start; then the stable
scripts could simply look up commit ids there when a patch is queued and
warn if they find it (which won't help in caes the regression is
reported after the patch is queued :-/ ).
