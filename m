Nico,

Your use of rtw_8822ce in the title finally registered on me. With that driver 
in use, that means that you are using my GitHub repo; however, newer kernels 
have the driver built in, but with names such as rtw88_8822ce. The difference in 
the name is deliberate. If you want to use the GitHub version, you must 
blacklist the ones from the kernel.

To check this, run 'lsmod | grep 88'. If you see a mixture of rtw_xxx and 
rtw88_xxx, then this is your problem.

Larry
