Then let's add Sean to the list of recipients. :-D

Sean, FWIW, this thread starts here:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/066b30cc-a9e6-4aeb-964d-71551e8ea3ef@posteo.de/t/#u

To quote the summary: "WiFi 7 MLO (5GHz+6GHz) on MT7925 silently stops
passing traffic after a few minutes, while the driver continues to
report a fully healthy link. Root cause appears to be a stalled WFDMA0
TX hardware queue."

Ciao, Thorsten
