No, the dependencies are explicitly expressed with the linker order.  So
it's not brittle, but rather very deterministic.

When linker order didn't work for all sorts of things, we added
different levels, but due to the huge number of init calls, of course
can not give each one their own level.

It's always been this way with Linux, nothing new here at all :)
