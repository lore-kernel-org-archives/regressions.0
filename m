Thanks for the detailed breakdown.

I'll build v7.0 vanilla and test it, as suggested. Fair warning
though: I'm on vacation this week, so I'll pick this up next week.
I've also never compiled a kernel before, so it'll likely take me a
bit of trial and error the first time around - please bear with me
if it takes a little longer than expected.

Will report back once I have results.

Thanks again,
Jonas
