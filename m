With just that one in, the machine survives - thanks!

It does give:

[  505.208354] device-mapper: raid1: Mirror read failed from 252:24. Trying alternative device.
[  505.239376] device-mapper: raid1: All sides of mirror have failed.
[  505.239389] device-mapper: raid1: Read failure on mirror device 252:25.  Failing I/O.
[  505.239394] device-mapper: raid1: Mirror read failed.

Although as far as I can tell the RAID hasn't errored and is still in sync.

If I turn the test case into a write (just s/pread/pwrite/ ) - the machine
still survives but then it does lose raid sync, and the raid resync
seems to stick until I do a 'lvchange --refresh main/lvol0'
which recovers after having spat out a:

[  865.319527] Buffer I/O error on dev dm-26, logical block 262128, async page read

It's not clear to me if it was designed to fail or not; I've not had
a chance to rerun the original qemu block tests yet, and I don't know
if old kernels succesfully used O_DIRECT in this case.

It still feels that my pwrite case above shouldn't cause a raid de-sync
(especially since a normal user can do it).
