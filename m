Yes as a start this will help to get it in 6.1 where it should apply
cleanly, thank you. I will do that next.

That might be an option yes. And the fix really neeeds to go back to
5.10.y at least as people are experiencing regressions from it (see

be welcome, but did not happened so far.

Thorsten, thanks for your work on the regression trackings!

Salvatore
