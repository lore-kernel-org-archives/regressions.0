Sorry for the mess. I'll work to improve the process to avoid this
to happen again.

FYI, in order to reduce build issues, we have a Jenkins instance
doing builds with gcc and CLANG at the media stage tree, before we even mer=
ge
them at the main media development tree. They run with allyesconfig for
x86_64 arch, with W=3D1:

	https://builder.linuxtv.org/job/media_stage_clang/
	https://builder.linuxtv.org/job/media_stage_gcc/

And another CI job testing bisect breakages as I receive pull requests,
applying patch per patch and using both allyesconfig and allmodconfig,
also on x86_64 arch with W=3D1:

	https://builder.linuxtv.org/job/patchwork/

The rule is to not merge stuff on media tree if any of those jobs
fail. I also fast-forward merging patches whose subject states that
the build has failed.

In order to help with that, on normal situation, I usually take one week
to merge stuff from media_stage into media_tree, doing rebases at
media_stage if needed to avoid git bisect build breakages at media_tree
(which is from where I send my update PRs to you).

Unfortunately, currently we don't have resources to do multiple randconfig
on Jenkins, as the build machines on the server are very slow. Yet, I'll
add CONFIG_PM disabled to the test set, as it seems to be a recurrent source
of troubles those days. I'll also try to identify a couple of other=20
randconfigs that would help to catch earlier problems like that.
If some other problematic Kconfig variables comes to your mind, please
feel free to suggest them for us to add to the CI automation.

-

In the specific case of this fixup patch, I didn't identify it as a build
issue, so it followed the usual workflow. We have a huge number of patches
for media, and it usually takes some time to handle all of them. This one
just followed the normal flow, as it didn't break Jenkins builds nor the
subject mentioned anything about build breakage.

Regards,
Mauro
