Yeah, I was thinking of it. It's why I'm not 100% sure for my proposal, to have
full synchronization.

Ok.

Yeah, the system for the coverage was likely having high CPU loads, which is similar
to my (simulated) environment. I usually have my system being idle when running the
coverage test cases. I didn't hit this specific failure before.

Lets leave it as of being. We can improve if needed in future :)

Thanks,
Gavin
