Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker.

Jiri, Benjamin, what the status here? Sure, this is not a crucial
regression and we are in the middle of the merge window, but it looks
like nothing has happened for a week now. Or was progress made somewhere
and I just missed it?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I'm getting a lot of
reports on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them and lack
knowledge about most of the areas they concern. I thus unfortunately
will sometimes get things wrong or miss something important. I hope
that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to tell me
in a public reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record
straight.
