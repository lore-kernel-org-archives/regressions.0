I want to be very clear here, I was working with Claude Opus on debugging t=
his issue. I am not a good programmer and work in on the hardware side of t=
hings, so this is only code I've tested and not of my creation, just hoping=
 to be helpful.



It appears the freezing (and maybe what I'll call micro freezing instead of=
 stuttering) was resolved after an issue was potentially identified in driv=
ers/gpu/drm/scheduler/sched_rq.c

I did a 20m play session attempting to reproduce the issue but was not able=
 to. Previously, I could reproduce this on-demand.

I will copy the writeup it created and the testing we did below. I am only =
claiming that the freezing had been seemingly resolved, not a particular fi=
tness or correct identification of the issue, that is for developers to jud=
ge.

Quotations are an output of a summery I had Claude create.

"
THE INVARIANT

drm_sched_entity_stats::vruntime is held absolute while the entity is linke=
d
in the run queue tree, and relative to min_vruntime while it is idle.
save_vruntime() converts one way on the way out, restore_vruntime() the oth=
er
on the way back in. drm_sched_rq_add_entity() calls restore unconditionally=
,
which is only correct if the entity has definitely been through save.


THE WINDOW

drm_sched_entity_pop_job():

    spsc_queue_pop(&entity->job_queue);      /* queue now empty */

    drm_sched_rq_pop_entity(entity);         /* takes entity->lock inside *=
/

No lock held across those two lines. A concurrent push seeing the queue emp=
ty
gets first =3D=3D true, calls add_entity, and restores a vruntime that has =
not yet
been saved -- adding min_vruntime to an already-absolute value. If the enti=
ty
is leftmost, get_min_vruntime() returns its own vruntime and it doubles.

It persists: pop_entity then finds the pushed job, takes the next_job branc=
h,
and update_vruntime() carries the inflated value forward. The entity sits f=
ar
right in the tree and is not selected until min_vruntime catches up, which
under sustained load may be effectively never.


EVIDENCE

WARN_ON_ONCE(!RB_EMPTY_NODE(&entity->rb_tree_node)) at the top of
add_entity(), after the rq lock, fires reproducibly.

That condition should be unreachable. add_entity() is reached only from the
"first job" branch of push_job(), and first is true only when the SPSC queu=
e
was empty. A linked entity implies its last pop_entity() peeked non-empty.
Empty queue and still linked cannot both hold in any ordered execution. Fre=
sh
entities are excluded -- entity_init() calls RB_CLEAR_NODE() unconditionall=
y.

Instrumented as a counter instead, with ring and comm logged:

  idle 10s:      0 races /  5662 restores
  gameplay 60s:  8 races / 43315 restores

  [ 192.754604] vruntime race on ring gfx_0.0.0 (comm kwin_wayla:cs0)
  [ 226.882135] vruntime race on ring gfx_0.0.0 (comm kwin_wayla:cs0)
  [ 292.226032] vruntime race on ring gfx_0.0.0 (comm kwin_wayla:cs0)

plus Xwayland:cs0 and vkd3d_queue on gfx, and many more on sdma0/sdma1. The
gfx_0.0.0 / kwin_wayla:cs0 entries are the compositor submission thread on =
the
graphics ring -- the process that dies when the desktop freezes.


CHANGE

The principled fix is presumably to close the window by holding entity->loc=
k
across the pop, which needs a _locked variant of drm_sched_rq_pop_entity().
I did not attempt that. What I tested checks the invariant instead: a still=
-
linked entity never left, so its vruntime is already absolute and its tree
position valid.

On stock 7.2-rc7 with this applied, freezes are gone against a trigger that
previously reproduced on demand, and perceptible hitching appears gone too.
The race counter keeps incrementing (35 in the last session against 295744
restores), so the window still opens at the same rate and is now absorbed -=
-
the timing has not merely shifted. Extended soak in progress.
