Hi,

Thanks. It certainly looks the commit dc4b4d04e1ca ("PCI: Prevent=20
shrinking bridge window from its required size") I referred to above might=
=20
indeed help here (For Thorsten's convinience: as mentioned above, it is=20
currently in the pci/resource branch slated for 7.1).

With the extra debug enabled, "shrunken by" lines appear in the log which=
=20
indicates the hotplug memory distribution algorithm goes to mess with the=
=20
calculated bridge window sizes in between resource sizing and resource=20
assignment and my fix aims to prevent that from happening.

If that fix does not help or does not fully solve the issue, please do=20
take a new log with that patch included into the kernel (preferrably with=
=20
all the fixes that are currently in the pci/resource branch so we don't=20
hit yet another issue that already has a fix). If you need to take more=20
logs, please include also /proc/iomem dump (as figuring the iomem layout=20
from dmesg is pretty tedious and error prone).

Also if you see this line, it's worth to posting the log (even if things=20
would appear as working):

amdgpu 0000:3e:00.0: Not enough PCI address space for a large BAR.

=2E..I'll see if I can somehow improve that as well (not a guarantee but=20
it's still worth taking a look, it appears also in the case you labeled=20
"good").
