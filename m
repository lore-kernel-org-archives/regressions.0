For MC-based drivers, in-kernel propagation *inside* subdevs is
mandatory, in-kernel propagration *between* subdevs is not allowed. The
latter is the responsibility of userspace.

For traditional (I'd say legacy, but I know not everybody likes that
term :-)) drivers that only expose video device nodes and do not expose
subdev nodes to userspace, the driver is responsible for configuring the
full pipeline internally based on the S_FMT call on the video nodes
only. This isn't applicable to the sun6i-csi driver, as it exposes
subdev nodes to userspace.

Would you have pointers to those comments ?

The flag is more or less required when you expose subdev nodes to
userspace.
