You confirmed my assertion that in terms of the PCI topology, there is
no connection between 05:01.0 and 06:00.0.

So the question remains: do we need to wait for the 05:01.0 link
timeout before the 06:00.0 driver does something that leads to
firmware starting the process of bringing up the tunnel and the link?

Sure.  But if we resume in a reasonable time, we at least have the
opportunity to notice what happened and warn about why the mounted
disk broke.  That's way better than getting bug reports that say
"resume is broken."

I did see that.  You may have also seen my sentiment that it's painful
for users to diagnose an apparent resume failure and find a BIOS
option to fix it.

If we can't make resume work in a reasonable time, can we at least
detect the case where it's going to take too long?  If so, maybe we
can warn about it, avoid suspend, or change the way we do it.
