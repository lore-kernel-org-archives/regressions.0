Thanks a lot for your bisection and detailed report, Josh.  Can you
verify whether this is still a problem?

The only commit that claims to fix 4d4c10f763d7 ("PCI: Explicitly put
devices into D0 when initializing") is 907a7a2e5bf4 ("PCI/PM: Set up
runtime PM even for devices without PCI PM"), and you already verified
that it did not fix the problem (both appeared in v6.16).

c855c9921da7 ("PCI/ASPM: Don't reconfigure ASPM entering low-power
state"), which appeared in v7.2-rc1, mentions a similar symptom
("Unable to change power state from D3hot to D0, device inaccessible") 
so it's possible that it would fix the issue.
