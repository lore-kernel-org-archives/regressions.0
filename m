Thorsten,
I agree with you, and it's fine for me to get this commit reverted, for the sake
of following the rule (which is something I agree about: as a user, the last thing
that should happen is to be afraid of what breaks if I update my system!!!!),
even though reverting this actually breaks anything that is not PS8640.

......though......

Everyone, please, look at how fundamentally broken PS8640 is... Qualcomm people had
the same issue as what is currently happening here.

They had to fix their DSI driver, as it was kind-of broken in a vagualy similar way
compared to MediaTek - and then they found out that they needed (and upstreamed) a
*hack* that had to be done specifically for the PS8640 Bridge [1]: their issue was
never really resolved, as then the same bridge started casually working for unknown
reasons (is it still working?), so they removed the hack [2] and called it a day.

[1]: 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/drivers/gpu/drm/msm/dsi/dsi_manager.c?h=next-20260726&id=ec7981e6c614254937b37ce0af9eac09901c05c5
[2]: 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/drivers/gpu/drm/msm/dsi/dsi_manager.c?h=next-20260726&id=9e15123eca7942caa8a3e1f58ec0df7d088df149

Especially in [2], the assmption from Dmitry sadly isn't correct, because this is
happening now on MediaTek, and here Runtime PM makes sure that the PS8640 is also
being enabled "a wee bit" earlier than DSI... but that doesn't seem to be enough.


Now, here I'm kind of shotgunning at the driver, but I wonder if anyone can try
the following patch before reverting this commit in mtk_dsi? Adam?
