Forgot to mention the reply from Bjorn:

```
I queued up a revert of 40613da52b13 ("PCI: acpiphp: Reassign
resources on bridge if necessary") (on my for-linus branch for v6.5).

It looks like a NULL pointer dereference; hopefully the fix is obvious
and I can drop the revert and replace it with the fix.
```

Ciao, Thorsten
