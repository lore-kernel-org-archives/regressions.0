While you might be "too close" to the details to feel like this past
year was not good with regards to "performance", I'd like to counter
that and say I have been immensely happy with the work you did last
year.  The tracking and pushing on people to get regressions addressed
and merged is thankless (as you well know), but vital to our project in
order to keep our users happy.

So don't beat yourself up at all, you're doing a great job.

thanks,
