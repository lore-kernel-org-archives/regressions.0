George,

No, you have the in-kernel version - the rtw drivers all start with "rtw88".

Your "regression" between 5.15 and 5.16 is that you switched from the GitHub 
repo to the in-kernel drivers. There have been many improvements in the kernel 
version since 5.16. Those are included in the GitHub version. One or more of 
them helped your system. I am not that familiar with fedora, but to get the 
kernel versions of the drivers, it is not necessary to "dnf" anything other than 
the kernel itself. All the in-kernel drivers come along with it.

Blacklisting is done by creating (as root) a blacklist file in /etc/modprobe.d/, 
not in the package manager. It is at a much lower level. On my system is such a 
file named /etc/modprobe.d/60-blacklist-rtw8822c.conf with contents of:
blacklist rtw88_8822ce
blacklist rtw88_8822c
blacklist rtw88_pci
blacklist rtw88_core

With this file, I am assured that only the drivers from GitHub will be loaded.

Larry
