Hmmm I don't see what in your patch would fix your issue.

I sent a patch 
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240829165048.49756-1-alexghiti@rivosinc.com/) 
that was merged in v6.11-rc7 which fixes something similar, could that 
be what fixed your problem?

The problem with this early code is that the MMU is not enabled yet and 
if your kernel is relocatable, the relocations are set "virtually" and 
then without the MMU, a call to an external function results in a 
trap...Which happens way too often, I have a few ideas to fix that, I 
need to find time to tackle this though.

I don't know FORTIFY_SOURCE, but I guess this could cause a call to an 
external function and then cause the issue I describe above right? We 
already remove all instrumentations from this early code so maybe we 
should remove FORTIFY_SOURCE too?

Thanks for digging into this,

Alex
