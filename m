Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker.

This is not my area of expertise, but there is another report about an
issue that was bisected to that particular commit:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/ac2693d8-8ba3-72e0-5b66-b3ae008d539d@linux.intel.com/

A fix for that one was posted here:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230110180243.1590045-1-helgaas@kernel.org/

You might want to look into the report and if it looks like a possible
duplicate give the proposed fix a try.

But as I said, this is not my area of expertise, you hence might want to
wait for the expert to share their view of things.

Anyway, to be sure the issue doesn't fall through the cracks unnoticed,
I'm adding it to regzbot, the Linux kernel regression tracking bot:

#regzbot ^introduced 07eab0901ed
#regzbot title pci: sriov_numvfs missing after removal of
EfiMemoryMappedIO from E820 map (possible duplicate)
#regzbot ignore-activity

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
