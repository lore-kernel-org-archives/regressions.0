Hi T.J.,

Thanks for explaining the locking issues. I tried a variation on your
first idea, using a separate inode_ever_requested field. In one four-boot
run, rmdir() was 22.36-22.72% faster and the continuous
mkdir() -> stat() -> rmdir() sequence was 7.35-9.01% shorter.
The tradeoff is an extra 8 bytes per kernfs_node in this build.

The watcher shortcut raises a separate concern: it also skips
clear_nlink(). An open FD can keep an inode alive without any watchers,
so that inode would still need its link count cleared.

The attached patch sets inode_ever_requested to true before calling
iget_locked().
It never clears the field, even after allocation failure or eviction.
A false value allows removal to skip the lookup; a true value retains
the existing lookups and link-count handling for every superblock.
It does not modify kn->flags or acquire a new lock during initialization.

Creation and removal still need the existing lifetime locking;
READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() do not provide that protection. I checked the
five kernfs_get_inode() call sites. Four use kernfs_rwsem with Shakeel's
fix applied; cgroup_may_write() instead relies on cgroup_mutex.
Those lifetime assumptions still need review.

I tested on 2f0c1cf72f46 (7.3-rc2):

  A: baseline + Shakeel's file-handle decoding read-lock fix [1]
  B: A + the attached prototype, without the old INODE_INITED changes

Four fresh boots ran in A1 -> B1 -> B2 -> A2 order:

                                      A1       B1       B2       A2
  original rmdir (us)                 9.758    7.541    7.563    9.741
  mkdir -> first stat -> rmdir (us)  30.023   27.317   27.356   29.526

The workload still removes empty cgroups, with no tasks or watches.
The stat() in the sequence is the first directory stat().
I used the same binaries on the bare-metal i7-12700KF, CPU0, with
sched_ext disabled, full preemption, the performance governor and Turbo
disabled. Both kernels used GCC 15.2 and the same config except LOCALVERSIO=
N.
Each value is the median of nine sample means, with 16 warmups per sample.
The original test measured 128 removals per sample; the sequence test
measured 32 sequences, without pauses between operations. For these two
metrics, CV stayed below 1.96% and boot drift stayed below 1.66%.
The improvement ranges compare each B boot against each A boot.
Both improvements held after dropping the first sample from each boot.

Separate traces showed ilookup() calls falling from 26 to 1 per removal,
or from 26 to 2 when one file FD was held open. Required clear_nlink()
calls and deletion lock counts were unchanged. Held-FD link-count checks,
notification positive controls and bounded open/remove checks passed.

I also tested first opens racing removal on fresh, unwatched files:
176 cases without tracing and 176 with tracing on each kernel,
including ordered controls.
Tracing confirmed 96 new inodes on each kernel. In B, the marker was false
on entry and true before iget_locked(). All successfully opened FDs
reported nlink=3D0 after removal.
I did not capture a remover waiting on the first lookup's read lock.
Eviction/recreation, distinct superblocks, other kernfs users and
weak-memory architectures remain untested.

kernfs_node grew from 136 to 144 bytes, and objects per 4 KiB slab fell
from 30 to 28. Simply reordering the fields does not avoid the size
increase in this build. I have not found a safe way to avoid this extra
memory cost. First-file stat() timing was too variable to quantify its
overhead. This is a prototype for review, not a finished fix.

Results, test sources and the patch are available at [2].

These results are from a microbenchmark. I have not measured the impact
on a real application. Given the extra memory cost and remaining
correctness questions, do you think this direction is worth pursuing?
