I'm on holiday until the 24th, away from my computer and I don't have
much time to dig into this. Are the DMA-capable devices on this platform
non-coherent? We'd need to check whether the bouncing logic somehow
overflows and corrupts adjacent memory. If the devices are coherent,
maybe the DMA spills over the kmalloc() boundaries, now that we
allocate buffers smaller than a cacheline even for DMA (no bouncing if
the DMA is coherent). Also, are these devices behind an IOMMU?

Yet another possibility is a not fully transparent system level cache
with a line size larger than what's reported by the CTR_EL0.CWG. If you
boot the platform with "swiotlb=noforce", do you still see issues? Or
there's no swiotlb buffer allocated anyway.

In addition to what Isaac suggests on slab debugging, it may be worth
enabling DMA debugging as well (I don't remember the config name).
