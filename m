Pardon me, but I don't understand what that "retry" loop
is even attempting to do inside function hidpp_send_message_sync().

It appears to unconditionally loop until:
   (1) the __hidpp_send_report() fails,
or (2) it gets a HIDPP_ERROR,
or (3) it gets a HIDPP20_ERROR other than HIDPP20_ERROR_BUSY,
or (4) until it has looped 3 times, which appears to be the normal exit.

It doesn't seem to have any provision to exit the loop earlier on "success"
(whatever that is).

And so when it finally does exit after the 3 iterations,
it then returns the last value of "ret",
which will be zero from the __hidpp_send_report() call,
or sometimes the most recent non-BUSY HIDPP20_ERROR seen.

Obviously I'm missing something, as otherwise this code would never have
passed review and made it into the Linux kernel in the first place.  Right?

What is this code trying to do?  And what am I not seeing?
