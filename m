FWIW, the reporter bisected the regression down to

552d6fd2f2 ("ath11k: add support for 80P80 and 160 MHz bandwidth")

Authored by P Praneesh, Ganesh Sesetti, and Sathishkumar Muruganandam,.
all of which I added to the list of recipients (just like Jouni Malinen,
who handled the patch). Could one of you please look into this?

While at it, let me update the tracking status:

#regzbot introduced: 552d6fd2f2
#regzbot ignore-activity

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
