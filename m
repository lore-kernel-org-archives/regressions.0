Thx from my side, too.

Yeah, I definitely don't want regzbot to be used to track ordinary
issues, but sometimes it's hard to find clear boundaries between issue
and regression. This is one, but I tend to say it's an issue, as users s
won't notice the leak in practice afaics. But there are other areas that
are greyish; an kernel Oops/Warning/BUG or a hang sometimes might also
not strictly be a regression, but I guess tracking them might be a good
idea, so I'm open to those.

Anyway:

I left it tracked until now, but after Jakub's reply nothing to actually
address the issue seem to have happened. I guess in that case it's not
that important and it's time to remove it from the list of open
regressions tracked by regzbot, if that is okay for everyone:

#regzbot invalid: not strictly a regression

Ciao, Thorsten
