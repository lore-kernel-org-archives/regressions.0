Except for one odd place i915 never uses dma_alloc_* but always allocates
memory itself and then maps it, but then treats it as if it was a
dma_alloc_coherent allocations, that is never does ownership changes.

This remark is for TDX in general, not Xen related.  With TDX and other
confidentatial computing schemes, all DMA must be bounce buffered, and
all drivers skipping dma_sync* calls are broken.

If we don't need the IS_ENABLED is not needed I'm all for dropping it.
But unless I misread the code, on arm/arm64 even PV guests are 1:1
mapped so that all Linux physically contigous memory also is Xen
contigous, so we don't need the hack.
