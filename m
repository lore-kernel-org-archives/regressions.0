I don't consider that "explicit."

The link order of object files does not express what symbols (if any)
are initcalls which are dependent on other symbols/initcalls from
which object file.

Brittle !=3D non-deterministic.

We now have implicit dependencies between some init calls, but not all.

Given two initcalls, are you confident that you could tell which must
run before the other, if there is even such a dependency?

It prevents us from reordering symbol layout for performance (or
security via FGKASLR), safely.  If such dependencies were *explicit*,
we could do so safely since we'd have information about which
initcalls are dependencies or not.

The implicit nature of such dependencies is thus what I would consider brit=
tle.

Hopefully initcall ordering related changes isn't the root cause of
the boot failure reported here, lest that lend more evidence to my
claim.
