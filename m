Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker.

I noticed a regression report in bugzilla.kernel.org. As many (most?)
kernel developers don't keep an eye on it, I decided to forward it by mail.

Chuanhong Guo, apparently it's cause by a change of yours.

Note, you have to use bugzilla to reach the reporter, as I sadly[1] can
not CCed them in mails like this.

Quoting from https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217394 :

See the ticket for more details.

BTW: there apparently is another IRQ override needed for a different
machine. See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216804#c8 for
details (ignore the comments before that, the quirk entry for that
machine was merged; comment 8 and all related to it really should have a
separate bug; that's also why this partly fall through the cracks here
:-/ ). The user is currently trying to create a patch.


[TLDR for the rest of this mail: I'm adding this report to the list of
tracked Linux kernel regressions; the text you find below is based on a
few templates paragraphs you might have encountered already in similar
form.]

BTW, let me use this mail to also add the report to the list of tracked
regressions to ensure it's doesn't fall through the cracks:

#regzbot introduced: 9946e39fe8d0
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217394
#regzbot title: acpi: IRQ override quirk needed for Aya Neo Air Plus 6800U
#regzbot ignore-activity

This isn't a regression? This issue or a fix for it are already
discussed somewhere else? It was fixed already? You want to clarify when
the regression started to happen? Or point out I got the title or
something else totally wrong? Then just reply and tell me -- ideally
while also telling regzbot about it, as explained by the page listed in
the footer of this mail.

Developers: When fixing the issue, remember to add 'Link:' tags pointing
to the report (e.g. the buzgzilla ticket and maybe this mail as well, if
this thread sees some discussion). See page linked in footer for details.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

If I did something stupid, please tell me, as explained on that page.

"email address will never be displayed to logged out users"
