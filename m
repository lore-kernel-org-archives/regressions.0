..

I'm still working on this issue, but I haven't been able to reproduce
it with my setup at all yet. I was hoping I could ask you a couple of
questions?

- Are both client and server run on a Raspberry Pi 3?
- Is there a specific workload that triggers the bug, or is it just
during boot when using nfsroot?
- Would it be possible to get a Wireshark network trace of the crash
(you'll have to run this on the server due to nfsroot).
- Can you share your export options from /etc/exports and the mount
options that the client uses?

Thanks,
Anna
