Hi,




I'm running the Ubuntu mainline 7=2E3=2E0-rc2 build on a Lenovo Legion R90=
00P

2025 and since switching to the 7=2E3 rc's the machine will, every so ofte=
n,

just hard reset itself out of nowhere=2E No timeout, nothing written to th=
e

log right before -- the box is mid-work and then it's gone, rebooted like

someone pressed reset=2E




The AMD FCH reset-reason decoder says both resets were an emergency softwa=
re

reset (0xE written to the 0xCF9 reset control register), not a clean reboo=
t

and not a power loss=2E On 7=2E3=2E0-rc1 the exact same symptom showed up =
as a

sudden power-off instead; on rc2 it comes back as a warm emergency reset=
=2E

Either way, no Oops, no panic, no MCE, no hung-task/lockup message anywher=
e

- the journal is alive until the very last line and then the machine reset=
s=2E




I'm kind of stuck on an RC kernel by necessity: the AW88399 subwoofer amp =
in

this particular model only got driver support in 7=2E3-rc1, which is why I

can't just fall back to the 6=2E12 stable kernel=2E So I'd rather report t=
his

properly than silently ride it out=2E Apologies in advance if this should =
go

to bugzilla instead -- point me at the right place and I'll move it=2E

What the logs look like

-----------------------




(All timestamps below are local time, UTC+08:00=2E)




1) FCH reset-reason decode, read at the start of the boots right after eac=
h

   crash=2E Both abnormal events decode identically:




   x86/amd: Previous system reset reason [0x00300800]: software wrote 0xE

            to reset control register 0xCF9

   x86/amd: Previous system reset reason [0x00300800]: ACPI power state

            transition occurred




   Every normal reboot of the same box on the same kernel decodes as:




   x86/amd: Previous system reset reason [0x00080800]: software wrote 0x6

            to reset control register 0xCF9




   So the two crashes are exactly the emergency reset path

   (emergency_restart() -> machine_emergency_restart(), which writes 0x0E)=
=2E




2) There is no kernel log at all preceding either reset=2E The journal kee=
ps

   getting messages (wireplumber, systemd, chrome) right up to the last

   second, then nothing=2E No panic, no oops, no hung task, no lockup, no =
MCE=2E

   pstore / efi_pstore has nothing from today either, which makes sense fo=
r

   a reset that isn't a panic=2E




3) What was happening at the time:

   - Crash #1 (session ended ~14:31, 2026-09-12): a screen recorder called

     "Cap" was running with ALSA/JACK via PipeWire; last log lines are its

     playback stats ("effective_fps=3D60=2E1")=2E

   - Crash #2 (session ended ~15:11): a few minutes earlier the Pixel phon=
e

     on usb3-port1 went through a bad enumeration storm:

       15:08:53 usb 3-1: device descriptor read/64, error -71

       15:09:00 usb 3-1: Cannot enable=2E Maybe the USB cable is bad?

       15:09:00 usb 3-1: unable to enumerate USB device

     (it finally enumerated at 15:09:12 as device #11), then about two

     minutes later the reset=2E Chrome was mid-playback at the same time

     (its last line is "Frame latency is negative: -0=2E045 ms")=2E




4) Sysctl timeline, because it rules out the obvious: I set

   kernel=2Epanic=3D10 / panic_on_oops=3D1 on this box at ~14:52, which is=
 after

   crash #1 (so that one ran with kernel=2Epanic=3D0 and cannot be a

   panic-timer emergency_restart) and before crash #2 (which, even with

   panic=3D10 active, produced no panic message while the journal was heal=
thy

   up to the last moment)=2E




5) Why I'm reporting this without a call stack: every reboot-path symbol

   rejects kprobe/ftrace on this kernel=2E register_kprobe() returns -22 f=
or

   all of:




     emergency_restart

     machine_emergency_restart

     native_machine_emergency_restart

     machine_restart

     kernel_restart




   (a probe on panic() registers fine, so the reset path is squarely on th=
e

   kprobe blacklist)=2E My fallback plan is a small module that detour-pat=
ches

   emergency_restart()'s entry to log the caller, but if there's a proper,

   supported way to get the caller I'd rather use that=2E




What I suspect

--------------




- Both crashes happened with the GPU and the audio pipeline busy at once

  (screen recording over JACK/ALSA with compositing in one case, Chrome

  playback in the other), and the audio side is exactly the code that is

  new for this model in 7=2E3-rc1 (ALC287 + AW88399)=2E The fact that the

  behaviour flipped from power-off (rc1) to warm emergency reset (rc2)

  between two RC releases is a good signal that something changed in that

  window, audio or reset-handling related=2E

- Not fully sure about this, but it feels like the resets happen when I'm

  playing a video that has audio (rather than silent content or plain

  static load)=2E Both events so far fit that pattern (Cap screen recordin=
g

  and Chrome playback both had audio going), but take it with a grain of

  salt - I can't claim it's a reliable trigger=2E

- nvidia-open 595=2E99=2E02 prints two boot-time assertions on this SBIOS:




    NVRM: GPU0 nvAssertOkFailedNoLog: Assertion failed: Invalid data

    passed [NV_ERR_INVALID_DATA] (0x00000025) returned from

    PlatformRequestHandler failed to get target temp from SBIOS @

    platform_request_handler_ctrl=2Ec:2174

    =2E=2E=2E failed to get platform power mode from SBIOS @ =2E=2E=2E:211=
7




  Looks benign (Lenovo doesn't implement PlatformRequest), just adding it

  for completeness=2E

- Not a thermal event: temps are normal and the reset-reason decode points

  to a deliberate software emergency reset, not an EC/platform trip=2E




Questions

---------




1=2E Given that the journal was still writing normally right up to the res=
et,

   is a "panic with a wedged console" scenario actually plausible, or shou=
ld

   I assume a direct emergency_restart() caller that simply never logs?

2=2E Anything known between 7=2E3-rc1 and -rc2 that touches ACP / SoundWir=
e /

   snd-hda-codec-realtek / AW88399, or the reboot/emergency-reset path,

   that could plausibly end in an unlogged emergency reset? The power-off =
->

   warm-reset behaviour change between the two RCs feels like a regression

   window I can bisect=2E

3=2E Where is the best place to track this - LKML, bugzilla=2Ekernel=2Eorg=
, or

   the ALSA or x86 lists? Who should I Cc?




Happy to help however I can: full journalctl -k dumps from the affected

boots, a serial console if I can set one up, testing patches, or running

a bisect between rc1 and rc2=2E And if someone can confirm a clean way to

catch the emergency_restart() caller despite the kprobe blacklist, that

would nail this in one shot=2E




Thanks for reading this far,

Starry
