Thx for the answer. FWIW, as this was a judgement call I mentioned this
in my last regression report to Linus; he didn't reply, so I guess it is
-- and will remove this issue from my tracking:

#regzbot resolve: can be solved by a nftables userspace update; not
nice, but likely best solution in this case
#regzbot ignore-activity

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

Everything you wanna know about Linux kernel regression tracking:

If I did something stupid, please tell me, as explained on that page.
