I finally found some real time to look into this:

This clearly indicates that my original idea about the AMD gart was
completely bonkers, as we're obviously on an Intel platform.

And this indicates that the device is trying to do a DMA write to
something that isn't IOMMU mapped.  Getting this from an initialization
change (commit 78013eaadf6 (x86: remove the IOMMU table infrastructure")
feels very strange to me.

Can you maybe post the full dmesg?  I wonder if there is interesting
initialization error in here.
