No idea, as I don't know where LKP settings are stored, nor what frequency
it is doing builds from git://linuxtv.org/media_stage.git, if any. Do you k=
now
where we can check such configuration?

In the end, patches there will end going to linux-next, so at least some
sort of coverage is there, but I'm not sure if LKP will always reply to
linux-media if the patch causing build regressions is there.

While being helpful, one problem with LKP is that it is hard to filter out=

reports per git tree. The only way to check if the report is applicable to
media trees seems to be looking inside the e-mail's body.

Fully agreed. That's why we opted to have a CI instance focused on media:
we should be able to program it to give feedback with the kernel build
parameters we use (Like W=3D1) and set it up in a way that it we can
customize to our needs (like testing for the architectures where media
drivers are known to be used in practice), and setting up an e-mail subject
that can be easily be filtered by our e-mail filters.

Regards,
Mauro
