So strictly speaking all this sounds a lot like this is caused by kernel
regression that thus should be fixed in the kernel once this was
bisected (which iirc hasn't happened yet).

OTOH this afaics (please correct me if I'm wrong!) is the first such
report, so the problem is likely pretty specific or might only occur on
your system. In that case just looking for some solution for your system
might be fine.
