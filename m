Hi all,

I just came across this patch from Andrei Rusu de Castro, posted on
2026-09-02 with "Fixes: ff643b81bc38" (the commit I bisected to):

Patch wifi: mt76: mt7925: stabilize STA_REC_MLD link selection
https://ratatoskr.run/linux-wireless/2026/09/17497919

Could this be the fix for this regression? Devin, you mentioned the
link count undercount is real but likely not the root cause - does
this patch change that assessment?

I'm happy to test it on my hardware if that helps.

Thanks,
Jonas
