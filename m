Subject: mm/migrate: fix wrongly apply write bit after mkdirty on sparc64
Date: Thu, 16 Feb 2023 10:30:59 -0500

Nick Bowler reported another sparc64 breakage after the young/dirty
persistent work for page migration (per "Link:" below).  That's after a
similar report [2].

It turns out page migration was overlooked, and it wasn't failing before
because page migration was not enabled in the initial report test
environment.

David proposed another way [2] to fix this from sparc64 side, but that
patch didn't land somehow.  Neither did I check whether there's any other
arch that has similar issues.

Let's fix it for now as simple as moving the write bit handling to be
after dirty, like what we did before.

Note: this is based on mm-unstable, because the breakage was since 6.1 and
we're at a very late stage of 6.2 (-rc8), so I assume for this specific
case we should target this at 6.3.
