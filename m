Ahh, great, many thx for the reply. Two things then:

(1) I wanted to ask why this patch is not in mainline or -net yet, but
then noticed the fix is among the patches of a one week old pull request
that afaics was not handled yet:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230927095835.25803-2-johannes@sipsolutions.net/

Guess that one fell through the cracks due to the Netconf 2023 workshop?
Maybe this msg gets things rolling again.


(2) Would have been great if that fix would have had a stable tag to
ensure a quick backport to 6.5. :-/ Made me wonder if this is an
accident, but doesn't look like it:

$ git log --oneline --grep 'CC:.*stable@vger.kernel.org' mainline/master
 -- drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/ | wc -l
11

Is there a reason why iwlwifi patches nearly never contain stable tags?
Reminder: a "Fixes:" tag alone does not guarantee that the fix is
backported.
