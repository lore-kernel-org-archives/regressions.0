I think I have found the commit. It is not in drivers/pci at all, and
my previous suspicion of 94555ea9a048 was wrong. Apologies to Simon
for the noise.

The regression is:

  cc6ed470caa2 ("drm/i915/vga: Avoid =
VGA arbiter during
                 intel_vga_disable() for iGPUs")
  Ville Syrjala <ville.syrjala@linux.intel.com>, 2025-12-08

I have added Ville, intel-gfx and dri-devel to Cc.

Two corrections to my earlier mail while I am at it:

  - 94555ea9a048 is not involved. My instrumented build shows
pci_set_vga_state() returning 0, and no -EIO anywhere. The
bookkeeping-mismatch theory was wrong.

  - The bit 4 (VGA 16-bit decode) =
"open question" from my last mail
dissolves. The firmware default on this =
machine is BRIDGE_CONTROL =3D
0x0002, i.e. bit 4 clear, on working and =
broken kernels alike. Working
kernels are fine only because bit 3 is never =
set. Bit 4 is not a
second regression and the kernel indeed never writes it=
.

## The mechanism: whoever touches the VGA arbiter first wins

The topology matters:

  00:02.0  i915    - directly on bus 0, no bridge =
above it
  01:00.0 amdgpu   - behind pcieport 00:01.0

pci_set_vga_state() writes PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA by walking the bridges
above the device. For the iGPU that walk is empty and writes nothing.
For the dGPU it writes 00:01.0.

vga_check_first_use() runs exactly once =
per boot, on the first
vga_get()/vga_tryget(). Whichever GPU triggers it =
determines whether
any bridge gets written at all. __vga_put() never calls
pci_set_vga_state(), so once the bit is set it stays set until reboot.

Before cc6ed470caa2, intel_vga_disable() unconditionally called

  vga_get_uninterruptible(igpu_pdev, VGA_RSRC_LEGACY_IO);

during i915 probe. The iGPU therefore always won that race, and since
it has no bridge above it, nothing was ever written.

After cc6ed470caa2 the iGPU takes the display->platform.dgfx =3D=3D false
path, bypasses the arbiter, and just sets PCI_COMMAND_IO by hand. The
arbiter now has no user at all until X starts. X then opens
/dev/vga_arbiter and targets vga_default_device(), which is the dGPU,
and __vga_tryget() reaches enable_them: with
PCI_VGA_STATE_CHANGE_BRIDGE =
set. That writes PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA on 00:01.0.

The commit's stated intent=
 was to stop the iGPU from clobbering the
VGA routing of an external GPU. =
On this machine, removing the iGPU
from the race had the opposite effect: =
it let the dGPU become the
first user and turned bridge VGA forwarding on.

## Evidence

I built v7.1.5 with a printk in pci_set_vga_state() and in the=
 bridge
walk, and did three boots with my workaround disabled.

1) v7.1.5 + instrumentation, normal graphical boot (X running):

  [10.716117] pcieport 0000:00:01.0: BRIDGE_CONTROL=3D0x0002 VGA_en=3D0
  [10.716695] i915   0000:00:02.0: set_vga_state decode=3D0 flags=3D0x1
  [10.717607] amdgpu 0000:01:00.0: set_vga_state decode=3D1 flags=3D0x1
  [10.718134] pcieport 0000:00:01.0: ctl 0x0002 -> wrote 0x000a
                                     -> read 0x000a

  # setpci -s 00:01.0 BRIDGE_CONTROL
  000a
  # cat =
/sys/class/backlight/gmux_backlight/actual_brightness
  16777215                                        <- broken

Note the write happens at 10.7s, which is when lightdm/Xorg starts,
not during any driver probe.

2) The same kernel booted with systemd.=
unit=3Dmulti-user.target, i.e. no
display manager, no X. Measured twice, 60=
 seconds apart:

  [10.167675] i915 0000:00:02.0: vgaarb: VGA decodes =
changed:
              olddecodes=3Dio+mem,decodes=3Dio:owns=3Dio+mem

... and that is the entire vgaarb log for the boot. No
vga_arbiter_notify_clients(), no pci_set_vga_state(), no bridge write.
That single line is vga_set_legacy_decoding() from intel_vga.c, which
does not count as arbiter "first use", so vga_arbiter_used stays
false.

  # setpci -s 00:01.0 BRIDGE_CONTROL
  0002
  # cat =
/sys/class/backlight/gmux_backlight/actual_brightness
  808  <- works

3) v6.18.41 (before the commit), normal graphical boot, X running:

  [9.160032] i915   0000:00:02.0: vgaarb: VGA decodes changed:
             olddecodes=3Dio+mem,decodes=3Dnone:owns=3Dio+mem
  [9.166861] amdgpu 0000:01:00.0: vgaarb: VGA decodes changed:
             olddecodes=3Dio+mem,decodes=3Dnone:owns=3Dnone
  [10.053446] i915 0000:00:02.0: [drm] [ENCODER:105:DDI A/PHY A]
              failed to retrieve link info, disabling eDP

  # setpci -s 00:01.0 BRIDGE_CONTROL
  0002
  # cat =
/sys/class/backlight/gmux_backlight/actual_brightness
  808                                             <- works

Here arbiter first use happens at 9.16s, during i915 probe, well
before X. By the time X calls vga_get() on the dGPU, vga_arbiter_used
is already true and vga_check_first_use() is a no-op.

So: same X, same hardware, same userspace. On v6.18 the iGPU gets
there first and nothing is written. On v7.1.5 the iGPU is no longer in
the race and the dGPU's bridge gets PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA set.

This also narrows the regression window to v6.18..v7.1, which is where
cc6ed470caa2 landed.

Boot 2 is the clean control: identical kernel, =
identical firmware
state, and the only variable is whether a graphical =
session starts.

## Why that kills the backlight

Recapping from my =
previous mail, since the audience has grown:

MacBookPro13,3 has an =
apple-gmux at PNP resource 0x700-0x7fe using the
indexed protocol:

  GMUX_PORT_READ         0x7d0
  GMUX_PORT_WRITE        0x7d4
  index magic            0x7cc / 0x7cd / 0x7ce

With PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA set=
 and 16-bit decode clear, the bridge
decodes legacy VGA I/O with only 10 =
address bits, so 0x3c0-0x3df
aliases onto 0x7c0-0x7df. Every gmux port =
above is inside that window.
The bridge claims the cycles and forwards them=
 to the dGPU, so every
gmux read returns 0xff and every gmux write is =
swallowed.

apple_gmux has already probed successfully by then, so it =
reports no
error. actual_brightness just starts reading 16777215 =
(0x00ffffff,
which is GMUX_BRIGHTNESS_MASK applied to all-ones) and nothing
controls the panel any more. brightnessctl, the Touch Bar keys and the
desktop slider all go through this one backlight device, so all three
fail.

## Workaround

  # setpci -s 00:01.0 BRIDGE_CONTROL=3D0000:0008
  # modprobe -r apple_gmux && modprobe apple_gmux

Since the bridge write =
happens exactly once per boot, doing this once
after the graphical session =
is up is sufficient for that boot.

## Where I think the fix belongs

I do not think reverting cc6ed470caa2 is the right answer, since it
fixes a real problem for dGPU users. But I would note that the iGPU
was previously acting as an unintentional guard: by always being the
first arbiter user, it kept bridge VGA forwarding off on machines
where nothing needs it.

Two things look wrong to me independently of that =
commit, and I would
appreciate an opinion from the PCI side:

1. __vga_put() never calls pci_set_vga_state(), so PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA
is set on first use and then never cleared, even after both devices
have settled at decodes=3Dnone. On this machine the final arbiter state
is decodes=3Dnone for both GPUs, yet the bridge is still forwarding
legacy VGA. That seems like a leak rather than intended behaviour.

2. vga_arbiter_notify_clients() drives both devices to decodes=3Dnone
when vga_count > 1, and the bridge write happens as part of that same
first-use path. Enabling forwarding on a bridge while simultaneously
telling every client it decodes nothing seems contradictory.

Either fixing (1) or having the iGPU still participate in the
arbiter's first-use accounting without doing the I/O grab would
resolve this machine.

I am happy to test any patch on this hardware. I =
have an instrumented
build set up and can turn a test around in a couple of=
 hours.
