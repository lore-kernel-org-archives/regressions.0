Thx for saying that, in cases like this there is always something in my
head that says "maybe the developers and maintainers would have done
everything just the same way and just as quickly, even if I hadn't made
so much annoying noise". But well, better save that sorry.

Side note: I sometimes wonder if reverts like this maybe should be send
directly to LinusT for mainlining with a ACK from the maintainer (e.g.
you in this case) to speed things up. Sure, having things in next for at
least a day (and running it through subsystem specific CI) can help
finding unexpected problems, but it delays things, too -- which
sometimes might result in a revert coming to late for a new stable
release. And that easily can mean that our users have to face known
issues for about one more week. :-/

Ciao, Thorsten

/me meanwhile wonders if Greg will still pick the revert up for the next
stable releases (currently in rc), if the revert reaches mainline before
they are released on Friday

/me will wait for the revert to hit mainline before he'll prod Greg
about it
