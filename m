None of which are even near the latest when it comes to resource=20
allocation improvements and fixes (though you didn't specify .x).

Hi,

Have you tried with this pending patch:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-pci/patch/20260219153951.68869-1=
-ilpo.jarvinen@linux.intel.com/

This too might be relevant here (it has been recently accepted for=20
next):

https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-pci/patch/20260313084551.1934-1-=
ilpo.jarvinen@linux.intel.com/i.

There are plenty of other fixes as well done relatively recently (though=20
some may be irrelevant for the kernels as old as you've been testing).

You didn't include any real logs that shows the error into this report,
those log snippets are useless in root causing where the problem=20
originates from. All dmesg logs should be taken with dyndebug enabled=20
(with CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG + dyndbg=3D"file drivers/pci/*.c +p" on the=20
kernel's command line). Please also dump /proc/iomem.
