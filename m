That's odd. You should still see the above messages also with this patch
applied, but you may now need to provide a valid device address before
being able to use device in case the bootloader has not provided one
(e.g. using btmgmt).

Are there any error messages in the log when running with this patch?

Does

	btmgmt --index 0 public-addr <bdaddr>

work?
