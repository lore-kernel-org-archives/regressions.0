Thx for the clarification. Would afaics be really good to get that fix
in to solve that problem. Bjorn, is this somewhere on your todo list?

There is another report from Mich (now CCed). Mich, can you maybe test
that if you haven't yet (your report is really verbose, which makes
things somewhat hard to follow)?

FWIW, Mich's report can be found here:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=221919

Quoting from there:
