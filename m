No worries, I just try to make that option something that developer
consider and use more often when dealing with regressions -- especially
when the problem like in this case made it to stable trees (either
though a backport or a new mainline release).

Thx for your work. And don't feel rushed due to my tracking. There are
risks involved in this and experts like you are the best to judge when
the right time to mainline and backport fixes is.

Ciao, Thorsten
