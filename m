It is really helpful and appreciated! Both that you found the regression 
and that you are helping debug and fix it.

Good find! I almost feel obsolete. Perhaps our new AI overlords should 
make a pension fund out of the proceeds obtained by training their 
models on the decades of our work so us old programmers can safely retire.

Jokes aside, I agree with the above analysis that a better fix would be 
to pull things under the lock, and interestingly, Philipp had a lock 
widening patch not so long ago but I don't remember what happened it or 
how exactly did it look. It would possibly have fixed this problem.

Anyway, I have prepared a branch with the two fixes if you would be kind 
enough to give it a spin:

https://cgit.freedesktop.org/~tursulin/drm-intel/log/?h=drm-sched-fair-fixes

In my testing it all looks good. Fingers crossed.

Regards,

Tvrtko
