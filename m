Resending to linux-pci as requested.

Since the first mail I have narrowed =
this down further, and in doing
so found that my original description of =
the root cause was partly
wrong. The corrected analysis is below. The short=
 version:

  - The regression is that PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA (bit 3) on the =
root port
00:01.0 is left SET after the VGA arbiter has settled with
decodes=3Dnone for both VGA devices. On 6.12 and 6.16 it ends CLEAR.

  - The 16-bit decode bit (bit 4) is not the cause. The kernel never
writes it. It only determines whether a bridge that is already
forwarding legacy VGA does so with 10 or 16 address bits.

  - The subject line therefore misattributes the cause. The aliasing
is a consequence, not the trigger. I have kept the subject unchanged
so the thread stays intact.

I have a v7.1.5 build with instrumentation in =
drivers/pci/pci.c and
drivers/pci/vgaarb.c ready to boot; I will follow up =
in this thread
with the traces.

## Summary

Since Linux 7.1 the backlight =
on a MacBookPro13,3 (15" 2016, Touch
Bar) cannot be controlled at all. =
apple_gmux still probes successfully
during boot, but the VGA arbiter =
leaves PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA set on the
root port 00:01.0. With legacy VGA =
forwarding enabled and only 10
address bits decoded, 0x3c0-0x3df aliases =
onto 0x7c0-0x7df, which is
exactly where the gmux indexed protocol =
registers live. The bridge
claims those cycles and forwards them to the =
dGPU. Every gmux read
returns 0xff and every gmux write is swallowed.

- Last known good: 6.16.10 (Arch linux 6.16.10.arch1-1)
- Also good:       6.12.51 (Arch linux-lts 6.12.51-1)
- Bad:             7.1.5   (Arch linux 7.1.5.arch1-2)

## Hardware

DMI: Apple Inc. MacBookPro13,3/Mac-A5C67F76ED83108C,
     BIOS 529.120.1.0.0 03/14/2024

00:01.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel =
6th-10th Gen Core Processor PCIe
        Controller (x16) [8086:1901] (rev =
07)
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Skylake-H GT2
        [HD Graphics 530] [8086:191b] (rev 06)   -> i915
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: AMD Baffin
        [Radeon Pro 455] [1002:67ef] (rev c7)    -> amdgpu

gmux: PNP HID APP000B, "Found gmux version 4.0.29 [indexed]"
      PNP resource 0x700-0x7fe

Note that 00:02.0 (i915) is not behind =
00:01.0, but 01:00.0 (amdgpu) is.

## Symptom

  $ cat =
/sys/class/backlight/gmux_backlight/actual_brightness
  16777215

16777215 is 0x00ffffff, which is GMUX_BRIGHTNESS_MASK applied to an
all-ones I/O read. Writes to brightness have no effect. brightnessctl,
the Touch Bar brightness keys and the desktop brightness slider all
fail, because all three go through this single backlight device.

## Root cause

PCI_BRIDGE_CONTROL (offset 0x3e) of 00:01.0, read after boot=
 has settled:

  6.12.51-lts   : 0x0012   SERR | VGA_16BIT,  VGA enable =
CLEAR  -> works
  7.1.5-arch1-2 : 0x000a   SERR | VGA enable, VGA_16BIT =
CLEAR   -> broken

I originally read this as "VGA_16BIT was cleared". That =
is not what
matters. I tested all four combinations of bit 3 and bit 4 at =
runtime
on 7.1.5 via setpci, reading actual_brightness after each change:

  bit3 VGA_en   bit4 16BIT   value    actual_brightness   result
  -----------   ----------   ------   -----------------   ------
       1             1       0x001a          808          works
       0             1       0x0012          808          works
       1             0       0x000a       16777215        BROKEN
       0             0       0x0002          808          works

Only the single combination "VGA enable set, 16-bit decode clear"
breaks gmux, which is exactly what the PCI-to-PCI Bridge specification
predicts: bit 4 only has meaning while bit 3 is set. So the regression
is that bit 3 is left set, not that bit 4 is clear.

This also matches the code. PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA_16BIT does not appear
anywhere in the v7.1.5 tree; it is not even defined in
include/uapi/linux/pci_regs.h, where the bit list goes straight from
PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA (0x08) to PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_MASTER_ABORT (0x20). The
kernel never reads or writes bit 4, so bit 4 cannot be the regression.

PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA is written in exactly one place,
pci_set_vga_state() in drivers/pci/pci.c, which has exactly two
callers, both in drivers/pci/vgaarb.c.

With bit 3 set and bit 4 clear, =
address bits [15:10] are ignored for
legacy VGA I/O, so:

  0x3b0-0x3bb  ->  0x7b0-0x7bb
  0x3c0-0x3df  ->  0x7c0-0x7df

apple-gmux uses these ports on this machine:

  GMUX_PORT_READ         =
0x7d0     (aliases 0x3d0)
  GMUX_PORT_WRITE        0x7d4     (aliases =
0x3d4)
  index magic sequence   0x7cc     (aliases 0x3cc)
                         0x7cd     (aliases 0x3cd)
                        =
 0x7ce     (aliases 0x3ce)

All of them fall inside the aliased window, so =
the bridge steals them.

## Direct verification via /dev/port on 7.1.5

Before:

  inb(0x7cc) =3D ff   inb(0x7cd) =3D ff   inb(0x7ce) =3D ff
  inb(0x7d0) =3D ff   inb(0x7d4) =3D ff

Clearing VGA enable, or setting =
16-bit decode, either one is sufficient:

  # setpci -s 00:01.0 =
BRIDGE_CONTROL=3D0000:0008    # clear bit 3
  or
  # setpci -s 00:01.0 =
BRIDGE_CONTROL=3D0010:0010    # set bit 4

After (gmux_is_indexed() magic =
sequence, write 0xaa/0x55/0x00 then read back):

  outb(0x7cc, 0xaa); =
outb(0x7cd, 0x55); outb(0x7ce, 0x00)
  inb(0x7cc) =3D aa   inb(0x7cd) =3D =
55        -> gmux responds

Then:

  # modprobe -r apple_gmux && modprobe =
apple_gmux
  apple_gmux: Found gmux version 4.0.29 [indexed]

  # cat /sys/class/backlight/gmux_backlight/actual_brightness
  118

118 is the value the panel had actually been stuck at the whole time,
which confirms that no write had ever reached the hardware. Writing
100 / 400 / 700 / 1023 afterwards changes the panel brightness,
visually confirmed.

Two differences stand out:

1. On 7.1.5, 00:02.0 gets "setting as boot =
VGA device". On 6.16 it
does not, even though 01:00.0 still says =
"(overriding previous)" in
both.

2. On 6.12 and 6.16 the i915 legacy =
decode goes io+mem -> none in a
single step. On 7.1.5 it goes io+mem -> io,=
 and then about 1.1 seconds
later io -> none.

The final arbiter state is =
decodes=3Dnone for both devices on all three
kernels, yet only on 7.1.5 =
does the bridge end up with
PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA set.

## Suspected commit

Of the commits you listed for v6.16..v7.1 in drivers/pci/vgaarb.c, the
one that best fits is:

  94555ea9a048 ("PCI/VGA: Pass errors from =
pci_set_vga_state() up")

pci_set_vga_state() writes PCI_BRIDGE_CONTROL on =
each bridge in the
path and only afterwards reads the register back, =
returning -EIO if
VGA enable did not stick. It returns from inside the walk=
, so bridges
further up the path are left unprocessed and the ones already =
written
stay written.

That error used to be discarded by __vga_tryget(). =
After 94555ea9a048
it aborts the function:

    err =3D =
pci_set_vga_state(vgadev->pdev, true, pci_bits, flags);
    if (err)
        return ERR_PTR(err);

    vgadev->owns |=3D wants;          /* now =
skipped on error */

and likewise for the conflict path, where =
"conflict->owns &=3D ~match"
is skipped. Either way the arbiter's =
bookkeeping stops matching what
was actually programmed into the bridge, so=
 the later transition to
decodes=3Dnone never issues the matching =
pci_set_vga_state(..., false,
...) that would clear PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA. The=
 bridge stays enabled.

The two-step i915 decode transition on 7.1.5 is =
consistent with an
operation that aborted partway and was retried.

Two other candidates I have not excluded, both of which change which
device is selected as the boot VGA device and could explain difference
(1) above:

  337bf13aa9dd ("PCI/VGA: Replace vga_is_firmware_default() =
with a
                 screen info check")
  fd390ff14451 ("PCI/VGA: Don't=
 assume the only VGA device on a system
                 is boot_vga")

I believe 2a93c9851b2b ("PCI/VGA: Pass vga_get_uninterruptible()
errors to userspace") can be excluded, since it only changes the
/dev/vga_arbiter write path, which is not used on this KMS-only
system.

## Workaround

  # setpci -s 00:01.0 BRIDGE_CONTROL=3D0000:0008
  # modprobe -r apple_gmux && modprobe apple_gmux

Clearing VGA enable is =
enough, and is what 6.12 and 6.16 end up with
anyway. This machine is KMS =
only and "amdgpu: vgaarb: deactivate vga
console" has already happened, so =
nothing depends on legacy VGA
forwarding here.

(I had previously been =
using BRIDGE_CONTROL=3D0010:0010, setting 16-bit
decode. That also works, =
but it masks the symptom rather than
restoring the pre-7.1 state.)

## Open question

I cannot explain why bit 4 reads as 1 on 6.12 and 0 on 7.=
1.5, given
that the kernel never writes it. The only full-register =
overwrites of
PCI_BRIDGE_CONTROL I can find are drivers/pci/setup-bus.c:907
(bus->bridge_ctl) and drivers/pci/probe.c:1571, neither of which
tracks bit 4. This does not affect the analysis above, since bit 4 is
harmless while bit 3 is clear, but it may be of interest.

## Notes

- The breakage happens after apple_gmux has already probed, so the
driver reports no error. The failure is silent.
- drivers/platform/x86/appl=
e-gmux.c only received cosmetic changes
during the 7.1 cycle, so this looks=
 like a PCI / vgaarb side issue
rather than a driver bug.
- A machine with a discrete GPU behind 00:01.0 and gmux at 0x700-0x7fe
is the affected shape. MacBookPro13,1 and 13,2 have no dGPU and no
bridge in the path, so they are presumably unaffected.

I am happy to test patches or revert candidates on this machine.

them to the dGPU. Every gmux read returns `0xff` and every gmux write is =
swallowed.
