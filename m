I agree with that it does not make sense.
But reverting that commit made the freedesktop.org kernel-5.18-0-rc2 not panic,
and adding it back made kernel panic
(actually, check for vblank->worker==NULL fires)

Yes, this is puzzling. That's why I need other people's opinion on this.
Does it matter the DUT is a slow machine (Pentium 120MHz)?
