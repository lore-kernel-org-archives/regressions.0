Thanks, I will try to find out if my laptop allows access to advanced BI=
OS options.

The Lenovo support site lists some BIOS updates for my laptop, though th=
e release notes do not mention any touchpad fixes.  The updates are not =
available via fwupd, so I probably won't be able to update anytime soon.

I also tried booting Arch's 6.18.5 kernel with the power cord unplugged =
to see if that helped, but I still saw the "i2c_hid_acpi failed" error.

It seems like the next step is to try to enable GPIO unlocking in the BI=
OS.
