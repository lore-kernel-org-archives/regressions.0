To interact with the reporters, please comment here:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217069

Sorry, I wish it was different, but I can't CC the reporters here
without their permission, because bugzilla.kernel.org tells users upon
registration their "email address will never be displayed to logged out
users".

FWIW, I forwarded your request yesterday and one reporter commented that
it didn't help. But having me as a man-in-the-middle is not a good idea.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
