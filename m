Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker.

I noticed a regression report in bugzilla.kernel.org. As many (most?)
kernel developers don't keep an eye on it, I decided to forward it by mail.

Aloka Dixit, apparently it's cause by a change of yours: bd54f3c2907
("wifi: mac80211: generate EMA beacons in AP mode") [v6.4-rc1]

Note, you have to use bugzilla to reach the reporter, as I sadly[1] can
not CCed them in mails like this.

Quoting from https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217635 :

> Distro: Arch Linux
> Kernel version: 6.4.1.arch1-1
> Happens on mainline kernel? : YES (linux-mainline 6.4-1)
> Note: linux-mainline 6.4.1 is not available at time of this writing
> 
> Arch linux bug:
> https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/78984
> 
> Summary:
> No network access even after connecting to wifi. Websites don't load, ping doesn't work.
> This didn't happen on kernel 6.3.x (specifically 6.3.9, the last 6.3 kernel provided by Arch).
> 
> Bug happens on both Arch-provided kernel and mainline kernel
> 
> Steps to reproduce:
> 1) On fresh boot, connect to a wifi network
>    a) Make sure wifi password is not saved beforehand
> 2) Ping a url with terminal, or open a website with browser
> 3) Ping fails to work / website doesn't load

See the ticket for more details and the bisection result that came later.

Aditya Kumar Singh, FWIW, I hope you don't mind that I CCed you, but you
already contributed a fix for the culprit, so it seemed the right thing
to do in this case.

[TLDR for the rest of this mail: I'm adding this report to the list of
tracked Linux kernel regressions; the text you find below is based on a
few templates paragraphs you might have encountered already in similar
form.]

BTW, let me use this mail to also add the report to the list of tracked
regressions to ensure it's doesn't fall through the cracks:

#regzbot introduced: bd54f3c29077f2
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217635
#regzbot title: net: wireless: iwlwifi driver broken on Intel 3165
network card
#regzbot ignore-activity

This isn't a regression? This issue or a fix for it are already
discussed somewhere else? It was fixed already? You want to clarify when
the regression started to happen? Or point out I got the title or
something else totally wrong? Then just reply and tell me -- ideally
while also telling regzbot about it, as explained by the page listed in
the footer of this mail.

Developers: When fixing the issue, remember to add 'Link:' tags pointing
to the report (e.g. the buzgzilla ticket and maybe this mail as well, if
this thread sees some discussion). See page linked in footer for details.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

Everything you wanna know about Linux kernel regression tracking:

If I did something stupid, please tell me, as explained on that page.

[1] because bugzilla.kernel.org tells users upon registration their
"email address will never be displayed to logged out users"
