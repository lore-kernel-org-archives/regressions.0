Depends on whom you ask. I'd say: It's kinda normal. It's best avoided
if there is no need, but if there is a need (like here) it's fine. And
some subsystems it even happens regularly iirc.

Well, it boils down to: we don't know how many others are affected that
are unable to bisect and/or report the problem. So usually it's best to
fix things like this for everyone.

Ciao, Thorsten
