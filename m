Many thx for your explanation, this helps a lot. And yeah, it's somewhat
tricky. But from what I see this looks a whole lot like a regression due
to one aspect you mentioned:

> 1. There is a new firmware for the Mediatek MT7925 BT chip.
> 2. There is an updated driver

Updated in-kernel driver I assume. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

> for the Mediatek MT7925 BT chip which is

Why is that? Do you by chance know which change caused this? I'm asking,
because according to
https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/firmware/firmware-usage-guidelines.html
states tat users "should not have to install newer firmware files to
keep their hardware working" (for example when switching to a newer
kernel version and hence its newer drivers). So the driver should
continue to work even with the older firmware.

Of course the driver therefore needs to notice that the firmware upload
failed and that it's using the old firmware. Is it maybe that a check
for that needs to be added?

Or am I missing something/got something wrong somewhere along the lines
here?

Ciao, Thorsten
