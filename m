[side note TWIMC: regression tracking is sadly kinda dormant temporarily
(hopefully this will change again soon), but this was brought to my
attention and looked kinda important]

Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker.

Adrian, Christoph I noticed a report about a regression in
bugzilla.kernel.org that appears to be caused by a change you too
handled a while ago -- or it exposed an earlier problem:

3710e2b056cb92 ("nvme-pci: clamp max_hw_sectors based on DMA optimized
limitation") [v6.4-rc3]

As many (most?) kernel developers don't keep an eye on the bug tracker,
I decided to write this mail. To quote from
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219609 :

> Bug 219609 - File corruptions on SSD in 1st M.2 socket of AsRock X600M-STX + Ryzen 8700G
>
> there are one or two bugs which were originally reported at
> https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1076372 . For details
> (logs, etc.), see there. Here, I will post a summary and try to point
> out the most relevant observations:
> 
> Bug 1: Write errors with Lexar NM790 NVME
> 
> * Occur since Debian kernel 6.5, but reproduced with upstream kernel
> 6.11.5 (the only upstream kernel I tested)
> * Only occur in 1st M.2 socket (not in the 2nd one on rear side)
> * Easiest way to reproduce them is to use f3 (
> https://fight-flash-fraud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html ). f3
> reports overwritten sectors
> * The errors seem not to occur in the last files of 500 file (=500 GB)
> test runs and I never detected file system corruption (just defect
> files; I produced probably more than thousand ones). The reason for the
> latter observation is maybe, that file system information are written
> last. (See see message 113 in the Debian bug report)
> 
> (Possible) Bug 2: Read errors with Kingston FURY Renegade
> 
> * Only occur in 1st M.2 socket (did not tested the rear socket, because
> the warranty seal would to be broken in order to remove the heat sink)
> * Almost impossible to reproduce it, only detected it in Debian kernel
> that bases on 6.1.112
> * 1st occurrence: I detected in an SSD intensive computation (as data
> cache) which produced wrong results after a few days (but not in the
> first days). The error could be reproduced with f3: The corruptions were
> massive and different files were affected in subsequent f3read runs (==>
> read errors). Unfortunately I did not stored the f3 logs. (I still have
> the corrupt computation results, so it was real.)
> * 2nd occurrence: A single defect sector (read error) in a multi-day
> attempt to reproduce the error with the same kernel (Debian 6.1.112),
> see message 113 in the Debian bug report
> 
> Consideration / Notes:
> * These serial links (PCIe) need to be calibrated. Calibration issues
> would explain while the errors (dis)appear under certain condition. But
> errors like this should be detected (nothing could be found in the
> kernel logs). Is the error correction possibly inactive? However, this
> still does not explain why f2 reports overwritten sectors, unless the
> signal errors occur during command / address transmission.
> * Testing is difficult, because the machine is installed remotely and in
> use. ATM, till about end of Janaury, can run tests for bug 1.
> * On the AsRock X600M-STX mainboard (without chipset), the CPU (Ryzen
> 8700G) runs in SoC (system on chip) mode. Maybe someone did not tested
> this properly ...

See the ticket for more details. Note, you have to use bugzilla to reach
the reporter, as I sadly[1] can not CCed them in mails like this.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

Everything you wanna know about Linux kernel regression tracking:
https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/about/#tldr
If I did something stupid, please tell me, as explained on that page.

[1] because bugzilla.kernel.org tells users upon registration their
"email address will never be displayed to logged out users"
