Yes, your patch works fine against my 6.18.12 kernel on my AMD64 machine =
and booting with extlinux
(previously not working)

I also played around a little with some variations and it seems as though=
 the adding in of the
=2Emodinfo into the strip is the key, caveat that in my messing around (b=
ased on inspiration from the
