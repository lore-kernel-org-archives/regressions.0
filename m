[CCing the regression list, as it should be in the loop for regressions:

[TLDR: I'm adding this report to the list of tracked Linux kernel
regressions; the text you find below is based on a few templates
paragraphs you might have encountered already in similar form.

Thanks for the report. I know a fix is already in the works but to
ensure the issue doesn't fall through the cracks unnoticed, I'm adding
it to regzbot, the Linux kernel regression tracking bot:

#regzbot ^introduced b11d31ae01e6
#regzbot title block/blk-wbt: wbt can't be disabled by default
#regzbot ignore-activity
#regzbot monitor:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230512093554.911753-2-yukuai1@huaweicloud.com/

This isn't a regression? This issue or a fix for it are already
discussed somewhere else? It was fixed already? You want to clarify when
the regression started to happen? Or point out I got the title or
something else totally wrong? Then just reply and tell me -- ideally
while also telling regzbot about it, as explained by the page listed in
the footer of this mail.

Developers: When fixing the issue, remember to add 'Link:' tags pointing
to the report (the parent of this mail). See page linked in footer for
details.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
