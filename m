Thx to both you and Stefan for the update.

Not totally sure, but I guess Linus stance in this case would be along
the lines of "commit 7a637784d517 made an existing issue worse; either
the people involved in it fix it, or we revert that commit[1], as it's
causing a regression". At least we *iirc* had situations he handled like
that.

[1] of course unless a revert would cause regressions for others --
which i guess might be the case here, as that was added in 5.18 already.
So let's not bring Linus in.

Well, Stefan kind of did to do so in his spare time, but asked for
"clear instructions to investigate this further". Could you maybe
provide those? If not: who could?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

Everything you wanna know about Linux kernel regression tracking:

If I did something stupid, please tell me, as explained on that page.
