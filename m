Don't worry, I know, that's why I used "#regzbot ^introduced
v6.0..v6.1-rc1" above.

I'm not blaming the patch mentioned in the subject, but this is the
report about an regression that shouldn't be forgotten about, hence I
track it, even if the discussion uses a misleading subject (hopefully
someone will change that).

Or am I missing something here?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
