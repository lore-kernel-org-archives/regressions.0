Ahh, great, many thx. That's hard to find for an outsider like other
people that run into this problem (IOW: mentioning it in the bugzilla
ticket would have been nice). Guess at least I might have found it, if
intel-wired-lad was archived on lore. Anyway:

I have to wonder: why is this in the "next"-queue? That patch doesn't
look really dangerous and it's fixing a regression from v5.14, so why
not merge it this cycle? Ohh, and a explicit tag to get it backported to
stable quickly might be good as well afaics:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/stable-kernel-rules.html

Ciao, Thorsten
