Hi there, hello. A little mid-update.

I bisected almost all range after 6.1.3 and the only untested commits
left are unrelated to my hardware (AMD-specific stuff). I spent a week
with a 6.1.1 kernel and didn't experience a single hang since, which
leads me to a couple of conclusions:

1) it's not a hardware issue after all, since certain versions don't
produce the bug
2) (this one's more an assumption) I might've got the version range
wrong.

I'm gonna try 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 as well (up to 7 more days for each), and,
depending on the output, bisect in a different range (now I regret not
doing it in the beginning).

At the moment the earliest *tested* commit is:
```
[15e7433e1dc202] arm64: dts: qcom: sc8280xp: fix UFS DMA coherency.
```
and it's marked as "bad".

Thank you for your patience.
