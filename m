Thank you for the Tested-by, and for bisecting it in the first place. The
report arrived with the commit named and a revert confirmed, which is most of
the work already done.

Something odd, since we are on the same laptop. Mine is a Framework 13 that
shipped with an MT7922, and it has no MediaTek power tables at all. I checked
every ACPI table on the machine rather than only the main one, and there is
nothing there for any vendor. So your oops cannot fire here on the same model
with the same card, which is why I had to inject tables to reproduce it.

Which means the difference is somewhere in the firmware, and I can only see my
side of it. Mine is an Intel 11th generation board on BIOS 3.17, dated October
2022. What are you on? Whether these tables came with a later release or only
ever appeared on certain boards decides whether anyone else is about to walk
into this.

While you are in there, does your geo table carry 0xff in the unused slots?
Someone turned up on the list yesterday with an ASUS padded that way, which
the driver takes as roughly -1 dBm and clamps every rate down to it. Whether
that is one vendor's habit or common changes what the right fix looks like.
