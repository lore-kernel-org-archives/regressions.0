The reporter recently confirmed in the ticket that the issue still
happens with 6.2.

There wasn't any reply from any of the input developers here or in
bugzilla afaics. :-/ Hmmm. Could someone from that camp maybe please
take a minute and at least briefly look into this as answer something
like "that might be due to a problem in subsystem 'foo'", "maybe ask bar
for an option", or "we have no idea what might cause this, this needs to
be bisected"? That would help a lot.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
