Not my area of expertise, but there was one patch was reverted on
Thursday that is somewhat related
(https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/3aa1dcaa4f6f5ae08936491e08bd456f331f2d40
), but that was more about shutdown/module unload aiui and likely
something else.

But there were other reports that sounds somewhat related (but careful,
I might send you on the wrong track here; CCing Devin, who wrote two of
the following messages):
