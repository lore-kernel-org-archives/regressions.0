Many thx for taking care of this. Is this something that is still
suitable for merging before 6.2 is released? If not it would be good to
directly add a "CC: <stable.." tag to ensure it's backported to 6.2
later, as maybe there are more people affected by this.

There is one small thing to improve, please add the following tags here
to make things easier for future code archaeologists:

Link: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216865
Link:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/15d0f9ff-2a56-b3e9-5b45-e6b23300ae3b@leemhuis.info/

To explain: Linus[1] and others considered proper link tags with the URL
to the report important, as they allow anyone to look into the backstory
of a fix weeks or years later. That's nothing new, the documentation[2]
for some time says to place such tags in cases like this. I care
personally (and made it a bit more explicit in the docs a while ago),
because these tags make my regression tracking efforts a whole lot
easier, as they allow my tracking bot 'regzbot' to automatically connect
reports with patches posted or committed to fix tracked regressions.

Apropos regzbot, let me tell regzbot to monitor this thread:

#regzbot ^backmonitor:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/15d0f9ff-2a56-b3e9-5b45-e6b23300ae3b@leemhuis.info/

/me wonders if this also should have a Fixes: tag.
