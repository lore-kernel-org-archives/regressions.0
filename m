From Mark Blakeney it sounded a lot like this is something that started
with 6.3, but would be good to confirm. Which brings me to the reason
why I write this mail:

Is anyone still working on this? There was radio silence already for a
week now. Okay, it's not really urgent, but I guess this should not fall
through the cracks.

Bastian, are you back?

If not: Does anyone know if there is hope that Bastien will be able to
look into this in the not too far future?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
