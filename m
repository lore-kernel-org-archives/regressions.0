FWIW, the stable team afaics usually does not fix anything in stable
trees before it's fixed in mainline. IOW: that fix now quickly needs to
go to Linus to get it quickly fixed in 6.1.y.

Side note: I'll soon post a rewritten section of 'Prioritize work on
fixing regressions' which is part of
Documentation/process/handling-regressions.rst. It among others will
cover this case:

```
* Whenever you want to swiftly resolve a regression that recently also
made it into a proper mainline, stable, or longterm release, fix it
quickly in mainline; when appropriate thus involve Linus to fast-track
the fix. That's because the stable team normally does neither revert nor
fix any changes that cause a regression in mainline, too.
```

Ciao, Thorsten
