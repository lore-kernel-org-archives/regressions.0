Thank you for the answer!

Ahh, I see, the change gained a stable tag somewhere along the way, great!

Hmmm. Just reread your reply to Wolfgang's report where you explain
things in more detail:
https://lore.kernel.org/stable/20260703160306.1651327-1-cel@kernel.org/

I now understand this better and it still feels to me like a situation
where Linus would want the fix to be included in mainline quickly[1] --
among others to not have another release with the bug[2] and because
it's something a user reported[3]. Yes, the root of the problem might be
in an older commit the Fixes: tag quoted above refers to -- but
apparently something (maybe the change Wolfgang and you suspected) seems
to have exposed the problem or made it happen more often at least in
6.18.y.

Anyway, if Wolfgang is the only one that seems to hit this and is happy
with the state of things I guess it's not worth arguing further about.

Thanks again for taking the time to answer my mail!

Ciao, Thorsten

[1] and Greg likely as well, as situations like that are the reason why
stable kernels released during or shortly after the merge window have
many hundreds of changes that have seen little testing (and we are
currently at the point where it could get some testing before hitting a
new release)
