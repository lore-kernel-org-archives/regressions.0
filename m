I will test this later tonight when I get home and report my findings.

If all is well, I do have a 6900XT I can dig out and cross validate.


Also, I attempted to find a synthetic way to induce the condition; the only=
 slight way I found to do so was running furmark tail, but the desktop neve=
r froze, only the desktop seemed to get mildly choppy. I have not yet check=
ed against the FIFO scheduler.  I was trying to find a more objective way t=
o trigger the issue, but it appears in my case I got rather (un)lucky with =
the specific game I was playing the reproduces it so well.

No problem for helping, I reported the issue and since I am capable of help=
ing at the very least test a fix and reporting on it, I feel I have an obli=
gation to, especially since you haven't been able to reproduce the issue on=
 your end.

It is really helpful and appreciated! Both that you found the regression
and that you are helping debug and fix it.

Good find! I almost feel obsolete. Perhaps our new AI overlords should
make a pension fund out of the proceeds obtained by training their
models on the decades of our work so us old programmers can safely retire.

Jokes aside, I agree with the above analysis that a better fix would be
to pull things under the lock, and interestingly, Philipp had a lock
widening patch not so long ago but I don't remember what happened it or
how exactly did it look. It would possibly have fixed this problem.

Anyway, I have prepared a branch with the two fixes if you would be kind
enough to give it a spin:

https://cgit.freedesktop.org/~tursulin/drm-intel/log/?h=3Ddrm-sched-fair-fi=
xes

In my testing it all looks good. Fingers crossed.

Tvrtko
