I'm digging further. That merge is what git bisect ended at, but admittedly my 
git skills and especially with a large codebase aren't too advanced.
While at 904e28c6de083fa4834cdbd0026470ddc30676fc, git show only shows the diff 
for tools/testing/selftests/Makefile which can't really be the culprit. 
However, git diff @~..@ has changes in drivers/hid/amd-sfh-hid/Kconfig (seems 
innocuous, too), but also some changes to drivers/hid/hid-core.c. Nothing 
obvious either, but at least it's not too far from the trace.

I will recheck some more, the Oops only happens with roughly 30 % chance 
during boot. When it doesn't, there seem to be no other issues until the next 
boot either. I made sure to reboot a few times after each bisect step, will 
look deeper into the area.

Thanks, and I agree in general. However, my case was in fact even worse :-) 
I'm totally aware of the badness of top-posting. It happened because I had a 
draft of the reply. Set In-Reply-To from the link in the wev archive and 
pasted the previous message from there. Couple days later, I just pasted the 
result on top and disregarded the existing text.
