Below is one more patch to try.  It should cause acpi-cpufreq to use
one shared cpufreq policy instead of 4 per-CPU policies which is
more adequate because the CPUs share one control register.  It should
also cause acpi-cpufreq to update the control register only on CPU0.

Let's see if this changes the control register access pattern sufficiently
to work around the power button problem.

In any case, please send the output of

$ grep -r . /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/

from a kernel with this patch applied.
