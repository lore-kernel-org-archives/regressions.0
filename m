Hi! Great to see progress for this regression.

FWIW: In case you need to send an improved patch, could you please add
this after your 'Signed-off-by:' (see at (¹) below for the reasoning):

Reported-by: Orlando Chamberlain <redecorating@protonmail.com>
Link:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/4970a940-211b-25d6-edab-21a815313954@protonmail.com
Fixes: 7c395ea521e6 ("Bluetooth: Query LE tx power on startup")

And if the patch is already good to go: could the subsystem maintainer
please add it when applying? See (¹) for the reasoning.

Ciao, Thorsten, your Linux kernel regression tracker.


(¹) Long story: The commit message would benefit from a link to the
regression report, for reasons explained in
Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst. To quote:

```
If related discussions or any other background information behind the
change can be found on the web, add 'Link:' tags pointing to it. In case
your patch fixes a bug, for example, add a tag with a URL referencing
the report in the mailing list archives or a bug tracker;
```

This concept is old, but the text was reworked recently to make this use
case for the Link: tag clearer. For details see:
https://git.kernel.org/linus/1f57bd42b77c

Yes, that "Link:" is not really crucial; but it's good to have if
someone needs to look into the backstory of this change sometime in the
future. But I care for a different reason. I'm tracking this regression
(and others) with regzbot, my Linux kernel regression tracking bot. This
bot will notice if a patch with a Link: tag to a tracked regression gets
posted and record that, which allowed anyone looking into the regression
to quickly gasp the current status from regzbot's webui
(https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/regzbot ) or its reports. The
bot will also notice if a commit with a Link: tag to a regression report
is applied by Linus and then automatically mark the regression as
resolved then.

IOW: this tag makes my life a regression tracker a lot easier, as I
otherwise have to tell regzbot manually when the fix lands. :-/


P.S.: As a Linux kernel regression tracker I'm getting a lot of reports
on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them. Unfortunately
therefore I sometimes will get things wrong or miss something important.
I hope that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to
tell me about it in a public reply. That's in everyone's interest, as
what I wrote above might be misleading to everyone reading this; any
suggestion I gave they thus might sent someone reading this down the
wrong rabbit hole, which none of us wants.

BTW, I have no personal interest in this issue, which is tracked using
regzbot, my Linux kernel regression tracking bot
(https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/regzbot/). I'm only posting
this mail to get things rolling again and hence don't need to be CC on
all further activities wrt to this regression.
