First, thanks to everyone helping out with this - really appreciate
the time you're all putting in.

One correction to how I described this earlier: the connection does
NOT reliably self-heal on its own. I have manually intervened every
single time to restore connectivity - either by disconnecting and
reconnecting the WiFi connection, or by switching to my band-lock
workaround (forcing 5GHz-only, which disables MLO). What I can say
for certain: the system itself has never needed a reboot - it stays
fully responsive throughout, only the WiFi link itself needs manual
action to recover. Wanted to correct that record before it causes
confusion.

Update on the ROC tracing: three real freezes captured now with the
kprobes active (all confirmed via the WFDMA0 tail-frozen signature).

- Freeze #1 (15:37): no ROC activity in the trace. Fixed by
   disconnecting/reconnecting the WiFi connection fairly quickly.
- Freeze #2 (15:43): this time I deliberately waited longer before
   intervening. The trace shows several ROC events (rocabort, mloroc,
   rocwork) clustered together. Fixed by switching to the band-lock
   workaround (5GHz-only).
- Freeze #3 (16:15): no ROC activity again. Fixed by
   disconnecting/reconnecting the WiFi connection.

Uploaded all three logs to the bugzilla ticket if useful:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=221884

Still haven't gotten to confirming 6.18 as a clean baseline on my own
hardware - that's next on my list.
