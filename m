A "regression" for a commit that was in 5.13, i.e. almost 2 years ago,
is a bit tough, and not something I would consider really a "regression"
as it is core code that everyone runs.  Given you point at scheduler
changes also fixing the issue, this seems like a hint as to what is
wrong with your driver/platform, but is not the root cause of it and
needs to be resolved.  Please look at fixing it in your drivers?  Are
they all in Linus's tree?
