Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker speaking.

I noticed a regression reported in bugzilla.kernel.org that seems to be
handled there already, nevertheless I'd like to add to the tracking to
ensure it's doesn't fall through the cracks in the end:

#regzbot introduced: 5cd29012028d
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216412
#regzbot ignore-activity

See the ticket for details, there were a few replies already.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
