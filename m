Thx for the reports. This sounds a lot like a problem Hungyu Lin is
trying to fix with these patches:

[PATCH] fs/ntfs3: preserve colons in symlink targets
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20261029203457.59990-1-dennylin0707@gmail.com/

[PATCH] fs/ntfs3: preserve colons in volume labels
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20261029225856.1173-1-dennylin0707@gmail.com/

Please look into those -- and if your's is a different problem, please
report back.

Ciao, Thorsten
