Sorry, I have to deal with various subsystems and a lot of regressions
reports. I can't know the details of each of issue and there are
developers around that are not that familiar with all the practical
implications of the "no regressions". That's why I was just trying to
ensure that this is something safe to ignore. If you say it is, than I'm
totally happy and now rest my case. :-D

Ciao, Thorsten
