Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker again. Top-posting for
once, to make this easily accessible for everyone.

I sent below inquiry on Saturday and didn't get a reply; and I didn't
notice any other activity to get this regression fix mainlined soon.

Bluetooth maintainers, what's up here? I'd like to avoid getting Linus
involved, but I guess I'm out of options if this mail doesn't get things
rolling -- or alternatively an answer why this fix might better wait for
the next merge window to get merged.

Ciao, Thorsten
