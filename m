I hoped for a fix, but neither of those seemed to be clearly better.

I agree on the ugliness and I try hard to avoid that.  In this case I
waited too long after the regression was discovered, hoping for a fix
that was better than the revert.  And I should have asked for
trade-offs between the revert and the the CM4 regression.

I apologized earlier for omitting you when the regression was
discovered, and I'm still sorry.

Cyril opened the bugzilla April 30 and I forwarded it to linux-pci and
to Jim (but not you; again, I'm sorry for that omission) on May 2.
From my perspective we had almost a month to push this forward, but we
didn't quite make it.

I posted the reverts May 11, but I did not realize the regression to
you and other users they would cause.  I apologize for that.
