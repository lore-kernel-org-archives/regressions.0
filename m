FWIW, another user reported seeing the same problem on a different machine:

I am experiencing the same issue with kernel >6.2.x on Toshiba Z30
with Alps PS/2 DualPoint trackpoint / touchpad. The cursor jumps top
right even with the lowest sensitivity settings. It works just fine
with 6.1 or lower.
```

Pali, or anybody else: anyone any idea what's might be wrong there?
There afaics is only one recent commit to the alps driver (292a089d78d3
("treewide: Convert del_timer*() to timer_shutdown*()")); it it maybe
worth trying to revert it?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
