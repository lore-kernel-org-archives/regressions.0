That will just postpone the breakage, we really shouldn't break
userspace.

That being said, having userspace "break" because a file is no longer
present is not good coding style on the userspace side at all.  That's
why we have sysfs and single-value-files now, if the file isn't present,
then userspace instantly notices and can handle it.  Much easier than
the old-style multi-fields-in-one-file problem.

The fact that this is a valid option (i.e. no file) with that config
option disabled makes me want to keep this as well, as how does
userspace handle this option disabled at all?  Or old kernels?

I can drop this from stable kernels, but again, this feels like the runc
developers are just postponing the problem...
