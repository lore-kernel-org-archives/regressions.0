Since applying the final patch on Friday, I have seen no problems with 
either the backup snapshot or catching up with replication.  It sure 
seems like things are all fixed.  I haven't yet tried it on our 
production Galera cluster, but I expect to on Monday.

Here are Debian packages containing the modified kernel.  Use at your 
own risk of course.  Any feedback about how this works or doesn't work 
would be very helpful.

>>>> Thanks Pavel!  Early results look very good for this change.  I'm now running 6.1.120 with your added smp_mb() call.  The backup process which had been quickly triggering the issue has been running longer than it ever did when it would ultimately fail.  So that's great!

The machine was running 6.1.124 with the __io_cq_unlock_post_flush function removed completely.  That's the kernel we had celebrated yesterday for running the backup process successfully.
