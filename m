Right, makes good sense.

I was thinking of a reply from Hans on the Tegra driver series:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-media/patch/20230309144320.29375=
53-4-luca.ceresoli@bootlin.com/#25285456

=46rom what I understand there's some bridge entity that needs to be explic=
itly
configured to match the sensor's format via MC, yet the reply says that the
driver "doesn't use the media controller for anything at the moment" and
should not be converted to become a proper MC-driven device.

Well maybe there was a misunderstanding on my side, or Hans', or both.

Thanks for the clarifications :)
