I'm not asking the Linux regression trackers to fill that role, though.
I'm asking people who experience these issues report it to their vendor
directly because these device makers apparently have zero clue that
their spec non-compliance is causing painful experiences for their
customers and annoyance for maintainers. They keep pumping out more and
more devices with the same breakage.

This particular vendor has been great at engaging with Linux, but that's
not necessarily normal among all device makers, and I don't have
contacts with the majority of the vendors we've had to quirk for this
issue.

We did complain to the NVMe spec workgroup that their complaince cert
suite is not testing for this. There was a little initial interest in
fixing that gap, but it fizzled out...

Panjaj, okay with this one too?
