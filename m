It makes sense not to set the flag in some cases. For instance, the
uvcvideo driver creates an MC device to expose the camera's internal
topology to userspace, but doesn't create subdevs as the UVC protocol
doesn't allow fine-grained configuration of formats between entities. In
the sun6i-csi case, I don't think this is applicable, the device should
be configured directly at the subdev level by userspace as you can't
know in advance what will be connected to its inputs.

For what it's worth, the same reasoning should apply to the tegra
driver, and I think it should set V4L2_CAP_IO_MC.
