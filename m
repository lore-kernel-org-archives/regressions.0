Yup, no complains there. Thx for your work on this, Bastien.

But that debugging has already taken some time and it seem more is
needed. And apparently it's more than just a single user or two that is
affected by this. That's why I think it would be better to revert this
temporarily[1], unless a fix suddenly comes into sight.

[1] as strongly suggested by
https://docs.kernel.org/process/handling-regressions.html , which states
that a regression like this should ideally be fixed within a few days
after the report; we are long past this...

Thx for your help, too.
